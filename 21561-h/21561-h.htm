<p><img src="images/img-t.jpg" class="floatLeft" alt="T" />radition
shows us Fra Giovanni Angelico absorbed in his work, and either
caressing with his brush one of those graceful angelic figures
which have made him immortal, or reverently outlining the sweet
image of the Virgin before which he himself would kneel in
adoration. Legend pictures him devoutly prostrate in prayer before
commencing work, that his soul might be purified, and fitted to
understand and render the divine subject; and again in oration
after leaving his easel, to thank heaven for having given him power
to make his holy visions visible to other eyes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">006</a></span>But has tradition any foundation in fact? Why not?
Through his numberless works we may easily divine the soul of the
artist, and can well understand, how the calm and serene atmosphere
of the monastic cell, the church perfumed with incense, and the
cloister vibrating with psalms, would develop the mystic sentiment
in such a mind.</p>

<p>And can we disregard tradition in face of such humility of life,
such beauty of work, exquisite refinement of feeling, and sweetness
of expression!</p>

<p>Among all the masters who have attempted to imbue the human form
with the divine spirit, he is perhaps the only one who succeeded in
producing pure celestial figures, and this with such marvellous
simplicity of line, that they have become the glory of his art.</p>

<p>Whether it be the Virgin enthroned amidst groups of cherubim
sounding heavenly trumpets, or Christ blessing the just and driving
away sinners; whether the martyrs supporting their torments with
superhuman resignation, the apostles preaching the gospel, or
angels free in the air and chanting celestial glories; the same
spirit is in them all&mdash;at once intense, devout, and utterly
pure, in which the fervent believer and the true artist are
inseparably blended.</p>

<p>The reason is, that Fra Giovanni put into his work the flame of
an overpowering passion; under his touch features <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">007</a></span>were
beautified, and figures animated with a new mystic grace. He threw
himself entirely into his art which thus became the spontaneous
expression of his soul. "It was the custom of Fra Giovanni," says
Vasari, "to abstain from retouching or improving any painting once
finished. He altered nothing, but left all as it was done the first
time, believing, as he said, that such was the will of God. It is
also affirmed that he would never take his pencil in hand until he
had first offered a prayer. He is said never to have painted a
crucifix without tears streaming from his eyes, and in the
countenances and attitudes of his figures it is easy to perceive
proof of his sincerity, his goodness, and the depth of his devotion
to the religion of Christ."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
"FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class=
"fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>How this devout mind, full of the figurative sacred writings
then current, must have overflowed with visions, ecstasies and
miracles! And what tremors of awe must he have felt, in putting
these visions into colour! His Madonnas, their features suffused
with candour and humility, bend with maternal grace hitherto
unwitnessed, in loving contemplation of the Son, or&mdash;mothers
in glory&mdash;they bow to receive the homage of the Redeemer. His
saints ecstatically gaze at luminous celestial apparitions; his
golden winged angels <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id=
"Page_8">008</a></span>dance lightly beneath the throne of their
Lord or sound merrily the most various instruments, singing:
<i>laudate Dominum..., laudate eum in sono tub&aelig;, laudate eum
in psalterio et cithara, laudate eum in timpano et choro...</i>; or
else with their fair curly heads downcast they reverently worship
the divine majesty. What a feast of light and colour is in these
panels, gleaming with azure and gold like a hymn to religion and
faith!</p>

<p>"We know from him how the pious imagination of the men of his
time pictured the Kingdom of Heaven, with the angels, saints, and
blessed ones, and on this account alone his pictures would have
been of extraordinary importance in the history of religion. Not to
love Fra Angelico would mean to lack the true sentiment of ancient
art, for though we recognize the pious <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>
of the monk, there is in the heavenly beauty of his figures, and
the joy of youthful faith which animates the artist, a charm
unequalled in the whole history of Art!"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
"FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class=
"fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whether Fra Angelico ever actually had a master, it is
impossible to ascertain. There are critics who affirm that <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">009</a></span> if
anyone initiated him in art, imbuing him with his own sentiment and
style, it might have been the Camaldolese monk Lorenzo Monaco; but
Cavalcaselle justly observes that between Angelico and Lorenzo
Monaco there only exists that affinity which in coetaneous artists
results from community of thought, social conditions, and religious
sentiments. Two monks like the Camaldolese and the Dominican might
well show the same ideas, without implying a relation of master and
scholar between them.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id=
"FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
"fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Both critics and historians, however, agree in the assertion
that he began his career in art by illuminating codices and choral
books. Baldinucci and Rosini judge that his master in painting was
the Florentine Gherardo Starnina, whom Lanzi designates as "a
painter of life-like style." But Padre Marchese refuting this
opinion observes that "not to mention Vasari's silence on the
matter, the fact is very doubtful, because Gherardo passed many
years in Spain, and returning to his native land died in 1403, when
little Guido of Mugello"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id=
"FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
was only 16 years old, an age which scarcely admits of the first
steps in Art.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> But the date of <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">010</a></span>Starnina's death is now corrected and proved to have
been in 1408, so, taking into account the character of our artist's
works, nothing need now be opposed to the theory that Fra Giovanni
may have profited by the teaching of that master, while living in
Florence after his return from Spain; besides it is not proved
whether that journey to Spain was ever really taken. Historians, it
is true, tell us that Starnina, being obliged to leave Florence
after the Ciompi riots (1378), took refuge in Spain, where he lived
several years; but it is certain that in 1387 his name was
inscribed in the Guild of Florentine painters.<a name=
"FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class=
"fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Vasari does not doubt that Fra Angelico, like other artists from
Masaccio onwards, acquired his skill by studying the frescoes of
the Brancacci Chapel;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id=
"FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
but besides the fact that the style of those pictures is
diametrically opposed to Fra Angelico's, the latter could not
possibly have been in Masaccio's school, for as he was born in
1387, he was fifteen years older than Masaccio and already a proved
master, when the Carmine frescoes were being painted. Fra
Angelico's style is so individual and characteristic, that it might
rather be considered as springing from his own disposition, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">011</a></span>developed under the influence of his time. Studying
the works left in Florence by his great predecessors, leading a
retired life, and purifying every idea, every inspiration in the
fire of religion, Angelico was enabled, by meditation, to perfect
the models of the best artists of the "trecento", among whom we
should opine that the influence of Orcagna in his frescoes in the
Strozzi Chapel of S. M. Novella, was greater even than that of
Giotto. Indeed it is evident that what Orcagna began, is carried to
the highest development in Fra Angelico, who combined softness and
refinement with severity of form, grace of expression with nobility
of attitude.</p>

<p>The figure of the Virgin in the fresco of the Judgment in the
Strozzi Chapel, so grand and majestic in its simplicity, is again
recognisable in the panels of Fra Angelico, imitated with his own
especial character and spiritual feeling, full of grace and
humility, the soft lines breathing beauty and lightness. The saints
who appear to be actually in celestial repose, have also inspired
Fra Giovanni; the same gentle and contemplative expression which
irradiates the features of the elect is again visible in our
painter's figures. In the colouring of both, vivacity is combined
with softness, and vigour of chiaro-scuro goes together with
transparency of tint.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it is true that in certain respects, Fra Angelico
might be said to belong to the same school as Masolino.<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">012</a></span> They
are, however, at the antipodes from each other in sentiment and
artistic interpretation, for while the saintly Giovanni endeavoured
to idealize the human figure and render it divine, Masolino, like
most of his contemporaries, followed a style distinctly realistic;
yet it may be proved that in technique, both followed the same
rules, and worked on similar principles. In fact the similitude
between the two painters noticeable in their composition, softness
of outline, lightness of figures, and clear harmonious colouring,
tends to confirm the great artistic affinity which we have
indicated. Both of them used rosy tints in the flesh, with greenish
and yellowish shadows, both recall the older artists of the
"trecento" in the perspective, which is often incorrect, and out of
proportion. But how far superior is Fra Angelico when the work of
both in its full aspect is compared!</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fra Angelico has, it is true, conventional forms, and there is a
certain sameness in his heads with their large oval countenances;
the small eyes, outlined round the upper arch of the eyebrow, and
with a black spot for pupils, sometimes lack expression, or have a
too monotonous one, and the iris is often lost in the white of the
cornea; his mouths are always drawn small with a thickening of the
lips in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">013</a></span> centre, and the corners strongly accentuated; the
colour of his faces is either too pink or too yellow; the folds of
the robes (often independent of the figure, especially in the lower
part) fall straight, and in the representations of the seated
Virgin expand on the ground, as if to form the foot of a chalice.
But in his frescoes these faults of conventional manner almost
entirely disappear, giving place to freer drawing, more life-like
expression, and a character of greater power.</p>

<p>We will not repeat with Vasari that Fra Giovanni perfected his
art from the frescoes of the Brancacci Chapel; but we do not doubt
that he too felt the beneficent influx of the new style, of which
Masaccio was the greatest champion, and that he followed it,
leaving behind, up to a certain point, the primitive Giottesque
forms. There is in his art, the great medi&aelig;val ideal
rejuvenated and reinvigorated by the spirit of newer times. Being
in the beginning of his career, as is generally believed, only an
illuminator, he continued, with subtle delicacy and accurate,
almost timid design, to illuminate in larger proportions on his
panels, those figures which are often only parts of a decorative
whole. But in his later works while still preserving the simplicity
of handling, and the innate character of his style, he displays a
new tendency, and learns to give life to his figures, not only by
the expression of purity and sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_14" id="Page_14">014</a></span> ecstasy, but in finer
particularization of form and action which he reproduces in more
material style.</p>

<p>His clear diaphanous transparency of colouring is not used from
lack of technical ability, but to approach more nearly to his ideal
of celestial and divine visions, and succeed in a species of
pictorial religious symbolism.</p>

<p>In the midst of his calm and serene compositions Fra Angelico
has figures in which a healthy realism is strongly accentuated;
figures drawn with decision, strong chiaro-scuro and robust
colouring, which show that he did not deliberately disdain the
progress made in art by his contemporaries. Indeed we should err in
believing that Fra Angelico was unwilling to recognize the artistic
developments going on around him, and the new tendencies followed
by his eminent neighbours Ghiberti, Brunelleschi and Donatello. It
was not so; but he only profited by the movement as far as he
deemed possible without losing his own sentiment and character;
thus giving a rare example of self-knowledge.</p>

<p>Perhaps he divined that if he had followed the new current too
closely, it would have carried him farther than he wished to go;
that the new manner would have removed him for ever from his ideal;
in a word, that too intense study of the real, would have
diminished or entirely impeded fantasy and feeling. He
instinctively saw these perils,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_15" id="Page_15">015</a></span> and therefore kept
himself constant to his old style, and while perfecting himself in
it, he still remained what he always had been, and what he felt he
should be.</p>

<p>Though constrained to repeat to excess the usual subjects, too
traditionally drawn, "he often," as Burckhardt writes, "understood
how to avoid in the features of his saintly personages that aspect
of abstract impersonality, which had hitherto marked them, and to
animate them with delicate and individual life. He succeeded in
giving a new character to the time-honoured types used in preceding
artistic representations. To prove this it is sufficient to cite
the St. John Baptist&mdash;one of Fra Angelico's finest
creations.</p>

<p>He modifies the traditional type of Christ according to his own
faith and feeling. Deriving it from Giotto, with improvements
gathered from Orcagna, he excels both masters, impressing on it a
divine character, and giving to the face of the Man God a sweet
gentleness which is truly sublime. These qualities reach the
highest grade in the "Coronation of the Virgin" at the Convent of
San Marco, and in the picture at Pisa<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id=
"FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
where the Saviour is represented standing upright, in the act of
blessing with his right hand, while in the uplifted left he holds a
golden cup.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">016</a></span></p>

<p>He is represented full face, in all his majesty, his features of
an exquisite sweetness and nobility,&mdash;a grand figure, which
has all the seduction of a vision, such as our Dominican alone
could conceive and design.</p>

<p>As he could, in a manner no one had ever done before, give to
the figure of the living Christ the expression of infinite
goodness, ready for sacrifice; so in his Crucifixions, instead of
following the example of his contemporaries, who depicted Christ
already dead, with marks of sorrow on His features, and contorted
by the spasm of a violent death; he represented Him living, calm
and serene, conscious of the sacrifice He completed, and full of
joy in dying for man's salvation.</p>

<p>The type of the Virgin, too, though its characteristic
construction of features, and short and receding chin, are derived
from the Sienese masters, especially from Lorenzetti, in Fra
Angelico responds to an artistic idealization chosen by him as
approaching more the divinity of her person. The flowing robes of
the Virgin show her long and refined hands, but beneath that mantle
he draws no feminine figure nor can one even guess at it. All the
power of the artist is concentrated in her face</p>

<div class="poem_small">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">umile in tanta gloria,</span>
<span class="i0">(humble in such great glory)</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">017</a></span> on which the artist has impressed such candour, and
so lively an expression of ineffable grace, that one is
involuntarily moved to devotion.</p>

<p>The divine child with its golden curls, full and sunny face,
wide open and sparkling eyes, is in the pictures at Cortona and
Perugia depicted with rosy fingers in the act of blessing; in the
"Madonna della Stella" He embraces His mother so closely that He
almost hides Himself in her bosom; in the great azure-surrounded
tabernacle of the Linen Guild, He is smiling; while in the fresco
of the corridor at San Marco, He has an ingenuous wondering gaze as
He holds forth His little hand,&mdash;an expression so natural that
it shows a happy grafting of ideal representation, on a
conscientious and close study of the real.</p>

<p>Full of character, too, are the heads of his old people, with
flowing beards and severe aspect, and those of his saints and
martyrs, which were evidently either young novices of the convent,
contemporary brethren, or elder companions in the faith, portrayed
with sapient and ingenuous realism. But the figures which most
brilliantly display his genius, are those diaphanous angels, robed
in flowing tunics, resplendent with gold, and of infinite variety.
While admiring that multitude of celestial creatures, who praise,
sing and dance around the radiant Madonnas,<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_18" id="Page_18">018</a></span> how can we doubt
that they have visited his cell, and that he has lived with them in
a fraternal and sweet familiarity?<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id=
"FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class=
"fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even when he has to represent scenes of passion, Fra Angelico
mitigates the violence of action with softness of sentiment, for
anger and disdain never entered his soul; and in their place he
prefers to reproduce one character alone in all his figures with
their gentle expression. It is his own character, with its angelic
goodness of heart, which he incarnates in the divine beauty of all
these celestial beings. As in name and art, so in real life he was
truly "angelic," for he spent his whole time in the service of God,
and the good of his neighbour and the world.</p>

<p>"And what more can or ought to be desired, than by thus living
righteously," says Vasari, "to secure the kingdom of heaven, and by
labouring virtuously, to obtain everlasting fame in this world?
And, of a truth, so extraordinary and sublime a gift as that
possessed by Fra Giovanni, should scarcely be conferred on any but
a man of most holy life, since it is certain that all who take upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">019</a></span> them to meddle with sacred and ecclesiastical
subjects, should be men of holy and spiritual minds....</p>

<p>"Fra Giovanni was a man of the utmost simplicity of intention,
and was most holy in every act of his life.... He disregarded all
earthly advantages; and, living in pure holiness, was as much the
friend of the poor in life as I believe his soul now is in heaven.
He laboured continually at his paintings, but would do nothing that
was unconnected with things holy. He might have been rich, but for
riches he took no care; on the contrary, he was accustomed to say,
that the only true riches was contentment with little. He might
have commanded many, but would not do so, declaring that there was
less fatigue and less danger of error in obeying others, than in
commanding others. It was at his option to hold places of dignity
in the brotherhood of his Order, and also in the world; but he
regarded them not, affirming that he sought no dignity and took no
care but that of escaping hell and drawing near to Paradise. And,
of a truth, what dignity can be compared to that which should be
most coveted by all churchmen, nay, by every man living, that,
namely, which is found in God alone, and in a life of virtuous
labour?</p>

<p>"Fra Giovanni was kindly to all, and moderate in all his habits,
living temperately, and holding himself entirely<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">020</a></span> apart
from the snares of the world. He used frequently to say, that he
who practised the art of painting had need of quiet, and should
live without cares or anxious thoughts; adding, that he who would
do the work of Christ should perpetually remain with Christ. He was
never seen to display anger among the brethren of his order; a
thing which appears to me most extraordinary, nay, almost
incredible; if he admonished his friends, it was with gentleness
and a quiet smile; and to those who sought his works, he would
reply with the utmost cordiality, that they had but to obtain the
assent of the prior, when he would assuredly not fail to do what
they desired. In fine, this never-sufficiently-to-be-lauded father
was most humble, modest, and excellent in all his words and works;
in his painting he gave evidence of piety and devotion, as well as
of ability, and the saints that he painted have more the air and
expression of sanctity than have those of any other master."<a

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fra Giovanni Angelico, whose worldly name was Guido or Guidolino
(little Guy), was born in the year 1387; his father was named Piero
(surname not known) of Vicchio in <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_21" id="Page_21">021</a></span> the Mugello;&mdash;that
pleasant valley which boasts of having given birth to Giotto.</p>

<p>Vasari asserts that Guido's brother Benedetto, a miniaturist,
was also very clever in a larger style of painting, but the
researches of Milanesi quite refute this opinion, and show that
Benedetto did nothing more than copy choral books, and that he
continued this kind of work till his death.<a name="FNanchor_11_11"
id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class=
"fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>"The most ancient chronicles of the convent of St. Mark and St.
Dominic at Fiesole," writes Milanesi when registering the death of
Fra Benedetto brother of Angelico, in the year 1448, "remark simply
that he was a very good writer, and that he wrote and annotated the
choral books of St. Mark and some of those of St. Dominic." We have
only the evidence in Vasari and the "Annali del Convento di San
Marco," written after his Lives of the Painters to prove that he
was a miniaturist.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id=
"FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class=
"fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In these Annals it is added, with more historical truth, that
although Angelico "might have conveniently lived in the world, and
besides his own possessions might have gained any income he chose,
with the art for which he was <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_22" id="Page_22">022</a></span>famous even in his youth,
yet, for his own satisfaction and peace, being by nature steady and
good, and chiefly also for the salvation of his soul he preferred
to take the vows in the order of the Preaching monks."<a name=
"FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13"
class="fnanchor">[13]</a> This happened in 1407.</p>

<p>On the slopes of the smiling hill of Fiesole the foundations of
a new convent were being laid by Giovanni Dominici, the great
preacher and reformer, who wished in this new monastery to give a
model to all the cloistered orders which at the close of the
preceding century had greatly fallen from their ancient
observances. St. Antonino was among the first to embrace this
reform, and after two years Guidolino and his brother followed his
example, choosing the robes of St. Dominic.</p>

<p>On being received by the Dominicans they were sent to Cortona,
where St. Antonino and others already resided, there being as yet
no novitiate at the Fiesole convent. In 1408 they took the
irrevocable vows, but it cannot be ascertained whether they still
remained at Cortona, or returned at once to their own convent at
Fiesole. If the latter, the two brothers must have been involved in
the vicissitudes of the Fiesolan convent, which, refusing to
acknowledge <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id=
"Page_23">023</a></span> Pope Alexander V. (who was elected by
the Council of Pisa 1409), entered into a fierce contest with the
archbishop of Florence. The convent was abandoned by its inmates
who fled to Foligno to avoid the rule of Fra Tommaso da Fermo,
General of the Order, who had sworn obedience to the new Pope. They
were received as guests at Foligno by Ugolino de' Trinci, lord of
the city, and Federigo Frezzi, author of the <i>Quadriregio</i>.
Here they passed five years, being treated with great benevolence
by their brethren, nor did they leave until driven away by the
plague in 1414, when they again took shelter at Cortona where they
remained till 1418.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>When Guidolino entered the convent and took the name of
Giovanni, he must have been already expert in art; for the
vicissitudes which followed could certainly not have facilitated
the study of painting. In fact his works which remain at Cortona
are in so youthful a style, and bear the imprint of such freshness
as to remove all doubt on this generally accepted assertion.</p>

<p>While staying at Foligno, the Fiesolan refugees propagated that
severe form of life and strict observance which Giovanni Dominici
had taught in his convent at Fiesole,<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_24" id="Page_24">024</a></span> and brother Giovanni
again began his artistic work, for painting was to him like prayer,
i. e. his usual way of raising his mind and heart to God.
Unfortunately few of these first works have been preserved, but
from those few we are assured that he studied in Florence, from
which school alone he could have appropriated the noble manner
impressed on all his works; and that those who perceive an Umbrian
influence in his art, are very far from the truth.</p>

<p>There may be some elements common to both the Umbrian art and
that of Angelico; this, however, does not depend so much on the
teaching of the school, as on technical affinity; insomuch as
Umbrian painting in its lucidity, charm and accuracy of colour, is
in some measure derived from the art of illumination, and most
probably Fra Angelico took his style from the same source, as even
in his most perfect works, he always preserved a remembrance of
it.</p>

<p>In fact, his patient diligence and study of detail render his
pictures so many miniatures, done in larger proportions; the
lucidity of tint, the grace of the ornamental motives, the almost
exaggerated minuteness of execution, are decided proofs of the
artistic education of Fra Angelico. It is pleasant to imagine him,
during his sojourn at Foligno and<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_25" id="Page_25">025</a></span> Cortona, making
pilgrimages to Assisi, to draw inspiration from the works of the
great masters in the splendid church of San Francesco. There he
found his old friends, and might at a glance admire together
Giotto, Simone Martini, and Lorenzetto. We should say he admired
Simone and Lorenzetto more than Giotto, for the grace of their
figures, refinement of execution, and greater richness of the
accessories, robes and ornamentation, together with the pleasing
brilliance of colouring, all approached more nearly to Fra
Giovanni's own artistic sentiment than the style of Giotto.</p>

<p>And even less than the Umbrian painters or miniaturists (if
indeed there were any worthy to influence the artistic spirit of
our artist) did the landscape of verdant Umbria stir his soul,
which even the sweet slopes of Fiesole could not touch.</p>

<p>Doubtless from the heights of the convent at Cortona, which
dominates one of the finest views in Italy, the young monk admired
the beautiful horizon, and enjoyed the splendour of the verdant
plain, and the blue mountains, "enwrapt in mists of purple and
gold", as he had often at sunrise and sunset, enjoyed from his
Fiesole convent the gentle fields and dales "peopled with houses
and olives"; but, after all, these beauties of nature so often
displayed before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id=
"Page_26">026</a></span> him, were dumb to an artist who was
wholly absorbed in visions beyond this world.</p>

<p>The study of the verdant country never occupied his mind; in his
paintings, landscape is either an insignificant accessory, or if it
occupies a large space in the picture as in the "Deposition from
the Cross" in the Florentine Gallery, it shows plainly that it is
not the result of special study, of personal impressions, or of
love of the place itself. In fact it does not attract or interest
the observer at all.</p>

<p>Nor could this be otherwise; the inner life of the spirit, which
he lived so intensely, and so vividly transfused in the figures of
his Saints, must necessarily have abstracted his mind from his
surroundings, to which he therefore gave little attention. In this
he was faithful to the Giottesque principle of not enriching the
background, except by just what was necessary to render the subject
intelligible, and this without pretension, or new research.</p>

<p>His trees rose straight on their trunks, the leaves and branches
spreading in conventional style; his rocks have the usual
gradations which we find in the old school; the views of distant
cities are absolutely fantastic and infantile creations; only the
green plain is often illumined, in an unusual manner, by tiny
flowerets of many hues, while mystic<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_27" id="Page_27">027</a></span> roses crown the angels'
locks, adorn overflowing baskets, or rise on long stalks at the
foot of the Virgin's throne in transparent vases.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Such are the characteristics, the spirit and the sentiment that
appear in the works of Fra Angelico, who might be considered as the
last representative of that school of which Giotto was master; and
at the same time the initiator of "Quattrocento" art, whose
powerful development irresistibly attracted him. He painted so many
pictures for the houses of Florentine citizens, that "I was often
astonished," writes Vasari, "how one man alone could, even in many
years, do so much and so well." "And we also," justly observes
Milanesi, "are not less amazed than Vasari, for although many works
have been dispersed or are still hidden, yet a great number still
remain both in Italy and other countries, and, what is more
remarkable, the greater part are not mentioned by Vasari."<a name=

<p>We will follow our artist in his different places of abode, thus
establishing the various periods of his life and artistic
productions; from the Fiesole hills, where the first seedlings
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">028</a></span> of his fantasy were sown, to green Umbria, where his
early works are, works warm with enthusiasm, faith and youthful
candour: from Florence, which he enriched with admirable frescoes,
and innumerable pictures dazzling with gold and azure, to Rome,
where he left his grand pictorial legacy in the oratory of Pope
Nicholas V.</p>

<p>No record is extant of his first visit to Foligno, but in the

'pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">033</a></span> a
triptych with the Virgin and four Saints; an Annunciation; and two
"predelle"; one of which is said to have belonged to the picture of
St. Dominic, as the scenes relate to the life of that Saint, and
the other with some stories of the Virgin, to the Annunciation
mentioned above.</p>

<p>To the story of St. Dominic (which had already been treated in a
masterly manner by Fra Guglielmo, in the "arca" at Bologna, and by
Traini in his picture at Pisa), Fra Angelico has, in some scenes,
given a fuller development, but with less dramatic sentiment;
exactly the good and bad points which are more clearly shown in his
other works. The "predella", divided into seven parts, represents
the birth of Saint Dominic; the dream of Pope Honorius III., to
whom the Saint appears in act of steadying the falling church; the
meeting of the Saint with St. Francis; the confirmation of his rule
by means of the Virgin; the visits of St. Peter and St. Paul; the
dispute with heretics;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id=
"Page_34">034</a></span> the resurrection of the nephew of
Cardinal de' Ceccani; the supper of the Saint and his brethren; and
lastly his death.</p>

style="margin-top: 1em;" width="250" alt="DEATH OF ST. DOMINIC." title="" /></a><br />
<span class="caption">DEATH OF ST. DOMINIC.</span></div>

<p>The scene of the resurrection of the young Napoleon, nephew of
Cardinal Stefano de' Ceccani, had been already powerfully depicted
by Traini; in Angelico's hands it comes out restrained and cold,
the acts of amazement in the devotees present at the miracle, who
raise their hands in astonishment, are too conventional: and it is
precisely in the intermingling of these gestures of sorrow for the
death, and wonder for the revivication, that the Pisan artist has
brought out his best effects. As we have before pointed out, the
calm spirit of Fra Angelico avoided realistic representation; his
figures always suggest love, faith and resignation, but are never
agitated; like the soul of their author, they are incapable of
violent action; therefore when these should be drawn, the
representation falls below reality. We shall see instances of this
in other works of his.</p>

(Church of Ges&ugrave;, Cortona.)</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">036</a></span>One of Angelico's most familiar subjects was the
Annunciation, and the most interesting of the Cortona pictures, is
that of the angel's visit to Mary. Its motive is simple and clear,
as it was transmitted from early Christian art; the general lines
are unchanged, but the expression greatly so. Fra Angelico did not
disturb the religious solemnity of the apparition with useless
accessories; faithful to his own sentiment, he has clothed Mary
with humility. She sits beneath the portico, the book neglected on
her lap, her hands crossed, and her drooping head inclined towards
the heavenly messenger. The golden-winged angel with roseate robe
also bends before the Virgin, the right hand pointing to her breast
and the left to the dove which sheds celestial rays on Mary's head.
In the background Adam and Eve are being expelled from the
terrestrial Paradise, symbol of the ancient Christian legend which
directly connects the story of original sin with that of the
Redemption.</p>

<p>This mystic subject, which does not lack grace and freshness in
the Cortona painting, finds its fuller development in San Marco at
Florence. Here the Madonna is seated on a wooden stool, her head
projected forward almost in ecstasy, with hands clasped on her
breast, and in similar attitude the<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_37" id="Page_37">037</a></span> angel half kneels before
her. The scene takes place before a little grated window in the
colonnade of a cloister, utterly bare of ornament, but in this very
simplicity lies all the charm and poetry of Angelico.</p>

<p>Before a subject so ideal, so solemn, which reveals in such
intensity of faith and feeling how his thought spontaneously turned
to the prayer of the Salutation which was certainly on the artist's
lips as he painted, or was inspired by some sweet Annunciation hymn
such as this, which probably has been often repeated before this
entrancing picture:</p>

<p>Cavalcaselle, as well as Marchese, affirms that the scene of the
Marriage of the Virgin reproduces that of the picture in the Uffizi
at Florence. This may be, as far as the subject and scene go, but
in the disposition of the figures, the development of action, the
two works have nothing in common. Of course in both there must be
the priest who unites the bridal couple, and around them the usual
personages in various attitudes of complaisance, surprise,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">041</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">042</a></span> and rejoicing, but the grouping of the figures in
the predella at Cortona is more naturally conceived. The women on
the right appear to come from the house where they had met to
assist at the ceremony; the men stand on the left. The background
with its portico, and the walls, above which the trees of a garden
project, are shown with more truth and solidity. To give wider
scope to the scene Fra Angelico has depicted the marriage in an
open space. The picture in the Uffizi, on the other hand, is so
conventional both in architecture and landscape that it is
impossible to establish a comparison between the two.</p>



<p>The Visitation depicts the wife of Zacharias meeting the Virgin,
and lovingly embracing her; a serving maid leaning against the
threshold, half hidden by the door, is listening with devotion,
while another woman kneels on the ground in the road raising her
hands to heaven.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">043</a></span>In the Adoration of the Magi we find the usual
qualities of composition and feeling. One of the Kings has already
rendered homage to the Redeemer, and is talking to St. Joseph, who
thanks him with earnest devotion; and while the second falls prone
before the divine Child, and kisses His feet with profound emotion,
the third prepares himself to render the required homage. All
around are elegant little figures of pages and servants, in
life-like and natural attitudes.</p>

<p>The last story represents the Assumption of the Virgin, at
which, according to ancient tradition, Christ is present and
carries in his arms the soul of His mother in the form of a little
child.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">044</a></span>Padre Marchese wrote that both the Adoration and this
Assumption are in every respect similar, or replicas of those in
the Uffizi. If anything, the pretty little panels of the Uffizi
might be replicas of the Cortona ones; but in Florence the only
painting with the scene of the Adoration of the Magi is that in the
predella of the tabernacle of the Linen Weavers' Guild. Now, while
the Adoration in the Cortona predella is naturally and simply
pourtrayed, that of Florence is conventional and stiff, the vacuity
of some figures and their actions is very evident&mdash;therefore
this similitude also reduces itself to mere identity of subject.
The Assumption of the Virgin also offers very notable differences.
The predella at Cortona is more intense and severe, more simple and
hence more grand; while the little panel in the Uffizi shows that
the effort to embellish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id=

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">046</a></span> the scene has been too much for the artist, and the
intensity of sentiment is greatly lessened, being injured by
useless accessories. In that of Cortona, on the contrary, the
figures of the Apostles who hold the sheet on which the Virgin
reposes are full of expression and natural in action, the steep and
mountainous background has severe and grand lines, as if to
emphasize the sadness of the scene. Here the artist felt and
created, there he merely repeated himself.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The triptych, once on the great altar of the church of San
Domenico, now at a side altar on the right, has the Virgin seated
in the centre with the Holy Child upright on her knee, his right
hand is raised in act of benediction, and with his left he holds a
rose. Around the throne are four angels, one of which carries a
basket of flowers. In the side panels are St. Matthew, St. John
Baptist, St. John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene. Above in the
central compartment of the triptych, is the Crucifixion and the two
rounds on the sides represent the Annunciation.</p>

<p>In the Chapel of Sant' Orsola in San Domenico at Perugia there
was formerly a panel picture now divided into many parts and much
damaged. This was painted by Fra Giovanni for the Chapel of San
Niccol&ograve; de' Guidalotti, and may now be seen in the Vannucci
gallery at Perugia.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id=

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">048</a></span>The Virgin is enthroned with her Son on her knees,
His right hand in act of benediction, His left holding a half open
pomegranate. At the foot of the throne four angels are standing
back, the two first lift up a basket full of white and red roses,
the others peep from behind the throne of the Virgin who turns
lovingly to her little Son, who is entirely nude, and as rosy as
the angels' flowers, and those in three vases at the foot of the
throne. On the right of the Virgin are St. John Baptist and St.
Catherine; on the left St. Dominic and St. Nicholas. On the
predella, which is divided into three parts, were once various
scenes from the life of St. Nicholas of Bari, two of these are now
to be found in the Vatican Gallery. In a complex composition, they
represent the birth of the Saint; his listening to the preaching of
a bishop to a congregation of women seated in a flowery field; the
Saint saving from dishonour the daughters of a poor gentleman; and
the miracle of causing a hundred measures of wheat to rain down and
relieve the famine in the city of Nuri. On the upper portion the
Saint appears from behind a rock, having been invoked by some
devotees to calm a tempest which threatened to wreck their
bark.</p>

<p>The portion at Perugia represents the miraculous salvation of
three innocent youths, sons of Roman princes; and the death and
funeral of the Saint. In the lower part<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_50" id="Page_50">050</a></span> of the picture he is
extended on the bier surrounded by monks, women and poor people who
weep his loss, while above, his soul is being led to heaven by four
angels. The frame of the painting is now divided into twelve
fragments, each one containing a small figure of a Saint: they are
St. Romuald, St. Gregory, St. Laurence, St. Bonaventure, St.
Catherine, St. Peter Martyr, St. Mary Magdalene, St. Thomas
Aquinas, St. Peter, St. Stephen, St. Paul and St. John. The last
four figures have been mutilated in the lower part, and in these,
as well as the others, the colouring is much injured. If it were
desired to complete the altar-piece, at present, the gables of the
tripartite frame would be missing, but there is no doubt
that&mdash;as in the Cortona picture&mdash;the two small rounds in
the Perugian Pinacoteca, representing the Angel of the Annunciation
and the Virgin, on gold backgrounds, formed part. Padre Marchese
places this panel among the youthful works of the artist, "because
it shows more than his other works the manner and technique of
Giotto's school." Padre Timoteo Bottonio wrote that it was painted
in 1437, but the Dominican author adds that this is not likely, as
Fra Giovanni Angelico was at that time in Florence, where the
restoration of San Marco was begun, and also the building of the
new convent which he adorned with so many marvellous frescoes.</p>

<p>This would actually signify little. As the picture which is said
to have been painted for the church of Sant' Andrea at Brescia was
naturally done at Fiesole, this one for Perugia might well have
been executed at Florence. But though it recalls the most
characteristic works of the artist and, for liveliness of colour
and accurate study of form, may be considered one of his most
remarkable works, we have no hesitation in ascribing it to his
first artistic period. In both these altar-pieces the grouping of
the figures is still faithful to Giottesque tradition; it was only
later, i. e. when Fra Angelico had felt the artistic influences
developing around him, that he placed the figures in one picture on
different levels, to make a circle round the Mother of Christ.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">053</a></span>The type of the Virgin herself in this Perugian
picture is similar to that of the Cortona panel; they both have the
eyes wide apart, a short, receding chin, and small mouth;
characteristics which are also seen in the angels behind the
Virgin's throne in the San Domenico picture at Cortona. From an
architectural view the throne has here a much more antique shape
than in his later designs, where Renaissance forms predominate. As
to the picture at Perugia it has been so restored and arbitrarily
put together after the panel was divided, that it affords no
serious proof of authenticity.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>We must therefore conclude that the Perugian one was painted
before 1433, for could we possibly admit (as Padre Bottonio wills
it) that it was done in 1437, that is only a year before the
celebrated painting for the church of San Marco? And seeing that
when the Dominicans again obtained possession of their own convent
and returned to Fiesole neither Fra Angelico nor his brother Fra
Benedetto were among them, we may reasonably suppose that Angelico
was then at Perugia, painting the altar-piece for the Guidalotti
Chapel; and that he only returned to Florence when he had finished
that work, which we may date later than the panel still to be
admired at Cortona.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">054</a></span>These are the only works known to have been painted
by him while he and his brethren had left their beloved Fiesole
hills to seek peace and tranquillity in Umbria,&mdash;the only
records of that period of voluntary exile.</p>

<p><img src="images/img-w.jpg" class="floatLeft" alt="W" />hilst Fra
Angelico was putting the legends of the Virgin and St. Dominic into
colour in Umbria, Giovanni Dominici together with Leonardo Dati,
master-general of the Order, was negotiating with the Bishop of
Fiesole and Pope Gregory XII. to again obtain possession of the
convent founded by Dominici. It was only in 1418 that the Fiesolan
bishop acceded to their request, on condition that the Dominicans
would make him a present of some sacred vestments to the value of a
hundred ducats. This sum, writes Marchese, was taken from the
legacy left to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id=
"Page_58">058</a></span> convent by the father of St. Antonino,
who died about that time. A rich merchant having died in Florence
in the same year, leaving the monks of Fiesole six thousand
florins, it was besides decided to enlarge the building. The legal
act of free and absolute concession being signed, the
father-general at once sent for four of the monks from Cortona,
among whom, as we have said, were neither Fra Angelico nor Fra
Benedetto. This does not imply that all the others who had left in
1409, might not have returned later, and probably Fra Angelico
among them.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a
href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>It was in this convent from which on the side towards the ridge
of the Fiesole hill, he looked on the olives spreading their
silvery branches against the blue sky, that Fra Angelico, absorbed
in work and prayer, passed the greater part of his life. It is
impossible to determine at which of the many works that now adorn
the Florentine and foreign galleries, he worked during his stay in
Fiesole, where he remained till 1436; certainly he painted the
panel pictures for his church, the Tabernacle of the Linen Weavers,
and frescoes in some parts of the convent. That convent so dear to
him must have awakened in his soul many bitter and sweet
memories&mdash;whether he thought of the days when he <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">059-060</a></span>and his brother Benedetto first took their
vows, or of the successive vicissitudes when he and the brethren
were forced to abandon it.</p>

<span class="caption">CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN.<br />
(San Marco, Florence.)</span></div>

<p>Vasari asserts that "he painted an Easter candle in several
small scenes, for Giovanni Masi, a monk of the convent of Santa
Maria Novella; and also some reliquaries which on solemn feast days
were placed on the altar," and are preserved to this day in the
convent of San Marco. They represent the "Coronation of the
Virgin," the "Madonna della Stella" and the "Adoration of the
Magi." The Coronation has been too much damaged by useless
retouching to be able fully to judge of its merits. It is for this
cause perhaps that some people have ventured to doubt its
authenticity: "one perceives," writes Cartier, "his religious
conception, and desire to follow his model, but the whole
composition lacks order and space, the figures are heavy, attitudes
embarrassed, proportions short, outlines coarse and the whole
painting is strained."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id=

<span class="caption">MADONNA DELLA STELLA (OF THE STAR).<br />
(San Marco, Florence.)</span></div>

<p>Now this is not absolutely exact. Naturally if we compare this
little reliquary with the great "Coronation" at the Louvre, we find
the composition more compressed, but it <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_62" id="Page_62">062</a></span> is not confused.
True, the types of the Virgin and Redeemer have not that grand
simplicity which with sincere enthusiasm we admire in his later
panels of the same subject. But possibly we have here the artist's
first conception, an idea which he successively developed and
perfected till he reached the highest grade of beauty, first in the
picture at the Louvre, then in the truly celestial one of the
Florentine Gallery.</p>

<p>In the little painting of the Madonna della Stella (of the Star)
we have qualities of grace and nobility all Fra Angelico's own. The
six adoring angels on the slope of the frame, and the two seated at
the base playing musical instruments, not only fully reveal his
ability, but might be classed with those of the Linen Weaver's
Tabernacle as among the most beautiful and ethereal he ever
painted.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ANNUNCIATION AND THE ADORATION OF THE

(San Marco, Florence.)</span></div>

<p>The third reliquary which is divided into two parts represents
the "Adoration of the Magi," below, and the "Annunciation" above.
The Virgin has a book on her lap, her arms crossed on the breast,
and head extended towards the celestial messenger who kneels before
her; but both figures, though showing Fra Angelico's characteristic
sentiment, have exaggerated proportions; the neck is inordinately
long, the colouring enamelled, and so brilliant as to give the
picture the character of a fine and elegantly illuminated<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">064</a></span>
missal. In the "Adoration" the Virgin displays the same defects of
proportion, but among the figures of the three Kings and the
personages accompanying them, are some of exceptional elegance and
exquisite beauty. On the whole the scene may be classed among the
finest and most graceful of the works which Fra Angelico has left
to us.</p>

<p>There is a kind of reliquary in the Vatican Gallery, which
represents the Virgin seated, with the Child on her left arm. Her
raised right hand holds the rose, and at her feet kneel St. Dominic
and St. Catherine. Cavalcaselle supposes this to have been the
fourth of the reliquaries once in Santa Maria Novella, but it more
probably belongs to that small painting reproduced by Prof.
Helbig,<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> in the <i>Revue de
l'Art Chr&eacute;tien</i>, in which Angelico has represented the
death and assumption of the Virgin.</p>

<p>The under part of the picture, representing the death of the
Virgin, recalls, in the general grouping of figures, the same
subject now in the Uffizi Gallery; but in this one, four Apostles
are depicted in the act of raising the bier, while the others
surround the Christ, who holds in His arms the soul of His Mother
in the form of a babe. In the upper part we see the Virgin with
upraised arms, being received <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_65" id="Page_65">065</a></span> by the Saviour who
extends His hands as if in welcome. The type of the Virgin recalls
that of the small panel representing the "Adoration" and
"Annunciation." The Christ is, in the foreshortening and character
of the face, a repetition of that on the reliquary of the "Madonna
della Stella." The figure of the Virgin is incorporeal and
insignificant; but the angels who in varied attitudes dance around
the throne playing divers instruments, are charming and
graceful.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the ancient refectory of the Fiesolan convent Fra Angelico
painted a life-size Christ Crucified, with St. Dominic kneeling
below clinging passionately to the Cross. At the sides stand the
Virgin and St. John the Evangelist; there is also a figure of the
saintly founder, but it was either added later, or else has been
badly restored and cannot be taken as Fra Angelico's work. The
picture has been removed from the wall, and is now in the Museum of
the Louvre; it is damaged in several parts; the delicacy of
colouring is lost, the background spoiled, and only the figures of
the Saviour, the Virgin, and the head of St. John remain in
tolerable condition.</p>

<p>The other fresco in the old chapter-house (this also has been
removed from the wall, and is now in the Hermitage at<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">066</a></span> St.
Petersburg), represents the Virgin seated, with the Child on her
knee, between St. Dominic and St. Thomas Aquinas; all these figures
show signs of incompetent restoration, the outlines and drapery
having been repainted. Less spoiled perhaps by retouching, but yet
in a deplorable condition, is the other painting, a Crucifixion,
still existing in the Sacristy of the Convent. The Redeemer with
extended arms, has His head drooping straight on the breast, and
the legs are stiffened and curve to the right. A crown of thorns
encircles the head, which is surrounded by a great aureole; but the
head is small; and the face, with its insignificant features, lacks
the intense expression which Fra Angelico usually succeeds in
putting into similar subjects.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also painted the altar-piece for the great altar in San
Domenico at Fiesole, "which," writes Vasari, "perhaps because it
appeared to be deteriorating, has been retouched and injured by
other masters. But the predella and ciborium of the Sacrament are
better preserved; and you may see infinite little figures which are
lovely in their celestial glory, and appear indeed to come from
Paradise, nor can those who draw near ever look at them
sufficiently."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">067</a></span></p>

<p>The picture is now removed into the choir. In the centre the
Virgin with her Son, is seated on the throne; six angels stand
around her in act of adoration, and two kneel in front with vases
in their hands. At the sides St. Thomas and St. Peter are placed on
the left; St. Dominic and St. Peter Martyr on the right. The
retouching of which Vasari speaks, was done by Lorenzo di Credi in
1501, when the picture was reduced to its present form. We learn
this from a record in the MS. chronicle of the Convent of Fiesole,
which is quoted by Padre Marchese in his "Memorie."<a name=
"FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"
class="fnanchor">[20]</a> But the panel has suffered other and
worse things than this. Other figures taken from an older frame
have been substituted for those in the pilasters. Some coarse
copies have been put in the place of the three "stories" of the
predella, and the original one was sold, together with the
ciborium.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p>The predella, now in the National Gallery of London, is divided
into five compartments. In the centre is Christ robed in white, His
right hand raised in benediction, and a standard held in His left;
at the sides are a crowd of angels&mdash;some blowing trumpets,
others playing instruments, others again in attitudes of profound
veneration&mdash;all have <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68"
id="Page_68">068</a></span>robes of pure and brilliant hues
with azure wings lightly sprinkled with gold. The side scenes have
multitudes of saints, either standing or kneeling in adoration: on
the left are patriarchs, bishops, monks and martyrs, each with his
own emblem; on the right, a crowd of kneeling feminine saints among
whom we can recognise St. Agnes, St. Catherine and St. Helen, and
behind them a line of male saints, amongst them St. Cyprian, St.
Clement, St. Thomas, St. Erasmus, and others whose names are
written on their mitres. Still higher King David, St. John Baptist
and the prophets Jeremiah, Zaccariah and Habakkuk. The faces are
painted with great delicacy and accuracy, and although they show
some variety of lineament, the expression is rather mannered. The
outlines of the feminine saints are full of grace and those of the
other sex do not lack great dignity. Although the work is of minor
proportion, it shows a noteworthy progress when compared with the
conceptions of Orcagna.</p>

<p>The greater part of the draperies are rendered with most refined
colouring, so delicately toned and judiciously contrasted, that no
part of the painting appears either crude, or of exaggerated
richness; while the gold used in every part of the background
contributes to give great harmony to the whole. In the pictures
placed at the end of the predella, <span class='pagenum'><a name=

<p>This delightful work, which roused the admiration of Vasari,
contains not less than 266 figures and may justly be considered as
one of the gems of the collection. Executed with all the delicacy
of an illumination, it sparkles with bright but harmonious colours,
while the spirit of devotion which penetrates the whole is entirely
characteristic of the painter.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id=

<p>Angelico reached greater perfection in the picture of the
"Annunciation" of which Vasari says: "In a chapel of the same
church is a picture from the same hand, representing Our Lady
receiving the Annunciation from the angel Gabriel, with a
countenance which is seen in profile, so devout, so delicate, and
so perfectly executed, that the beholder can scarcely believe it to
be by the hand of man, but would rather suppose it to have been
delineated in Paradise. In the landscape forming the background are
seen Adam and Eve, whose fall made it needful that the Virgin
should give birth to the Redeemer."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id=

<p>This picture (purchased in 1611 by Duke Mario Farnese) is now in
the Museum at Madrid. The Virgin is seated on the right under a
graceful portico sustained by small columns. Her head inclines a
little towards the Angel, in the same attitude as in the Cortona
altar-piece and the fresco at San Marco. She holds the book on her
knees, and crosses her hands on her breast; while the golden winged
Angel, in its rose coloured robe, with an arm curved in similar
attitude of reverence, sheds light around, as in the painting at
Cortona. High up in the left corner the hand of the Eternal Father
sends down a ray of light, in the midst of which the Holy Spirit is
symbolized. In the background, as in the Cortona picture, Adam and
Eve are being expelled from Paradise.</p>

<p>In the predella are some beautiful "stories" representing the
"Marriage of the Virgin," the "Salutation," the "Adoration of the
Magi," the "Circumcision of Christ" and the "Death of the
Virgin."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href=

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">072</a></span>"But superior to all the other works of Fra Giovanni,
and one in which he surpassed himself, is a picture in the same
church (i. e. San Domenico at Fiesole), near the door on the left
hand of the entrance: in this work, he proves the high quality of
his powers as well as the profound intelligence he possessed of the
art which he practised. The subject is the Coronation of the Virgin
by Jesus Christ: the principal figures are surrounded by a choir of
angels, among whom are vast numbers of saints and holy personages,
male and female. These figures are so numerous, so well executed,
in attitudes so varied, and the expressions of the heads so richly
diversified, that one feels infinite pleasure and delight in
regarding them. Nay, one is convinced that those blessed spirits
can look no otherwise in heaven itself, or to speak under
correction, could not, if they had forms, appear otherwise; for all
the saints, male and female, assembled here, have not only life and
expression, most delicately and truly rendered, but the colouring
also of the whole work would seem to have been given by the hand of
a saint, or of an angel like themselves. It is not without
sufficient reason therefore, that this excellent ecclesiastic is
always called Frate Giovanni Angelico. The stories from <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">073</a></span>the life of Our Lady and of St. Dominic which adorn
the predella, moreover, are in the same divine style; and I, for
myself, can affirm with truth, that I never see this work but it
appears something new, nor can I ever satisfy myself with the sight
of it, or have enough of beholding it."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id=

<p>The painting is now in the Louvre at Paris, having been taken
from Fiesole during the French invasion of 1812.</p>

<p>Under a rich canopy with inlaid columns and brocade hangings the
Redeemer seated on the throne, places the crown on the head of his
Mother, who kneels before him, with hands crossed on her bosom.
Around them angels are making the air resound with the voice of
song, and the music of many instruments. Saints, male and female
circle round, some standing, others kneeling, their fixed eyes and
ecstatic features denoting their joy in such divine splendour.
Among the saints are the great personages of the religious orders,
together with bishops and emperors. On the right, among the
kneeling female saints are seen St. Agnes tenderly pressing the
lamb to her breast, St. Catherine holding her wheel of torture and
a palm, St. Ursula clasps the arrow which united her in death to
her divine Spouse, St. Cecilia's pretty head is garlanded with
flowers, while St. Mary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74"
id="Page_74">074</a></span>Magdalene turns her back showing the
rich locks of hair flowing over her shoulder as she holds the vase
of ointment in her left hand. On the opposite side are St. Dominic
with the lily and open book, St. Augustine, St. Benedict, St.
Anthony and St. Francis. On a higher level St. Louis, with his
crown of <i>fiordalise</i>, talks with St. Thomas; while St.
Nicholas supports himself with both hands on his pastoral
staff.</p>

<p>"It is a clever composition, wonderfully balanced, and the
solemnity of style does not at all exclude exuberance of life or
infinite variety of ideas.</p>

<p>"The bodies are almost diaphanous, the heads ethereal, the
atmosphere and light have a touch of the supernatural. Up to this
point the subject is subdued, but the colours lively and
pure&mdash;among which blue and carmine predominate&mdash;gleam
with particular splendour."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id=

<p>The predella contains in some small compositions the chief
episodes in the life of St. Dominic, excepting the central
compartment where Christ is drawn, issuing from the sepulchre
between the Virgin and St. John. The compositions are all executed
with that love and delicacy which <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_75" id="Page_75">075</a></span>are the glory of the
artist, but even these little stories, like the larger panel, have
been more or less injured by repeated restorations.</p>

<p>A similar subject now in the Uffizi Gallery at Florence and
which Fra Angelico painted for the church of Santa Maria Novella,
is still more aerial and celestial, a perfect masterpiece of
sentiment and mystic expression.</p>

<p>Here also Fra Angelico clings to that traditional
characteristic, peculiarly his own&mdash;the art of sacred vision,
but with what new life he animates it, and what poetical witchery
he throws into this creation of his ascetic fantasy!</p>

<p>His predecessors reproduced with slight varieties the model of
Giotto, and the great Florentine painter himself has given us the
scene in its most simple reality. High in the central part of
Giotto's "Coronation" Christ places the crown on the Virgin, who
with hands crossed, bows her head to receive the homage of her Son.
But on her face there is no expression of ecstatic joy, modest,
indeed "humble in the midst of glory", she droops her eyes, almost
as if she dared not rest them on the Saviour. Angels and saints,
symmetrically disposed at the sides, fill the whole background of
the picture, with heads either raised in admiration or bowed in
respect, but in attitudes so similar, that they give a sense of
monotony. Then come the saints, some kneeling at the foot of the
throne, and others in the side wings of the triptych, reverently
bowing to the Mother of God.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">076</a></span></p>

<p>Fra Angelico repeats the principal motive, but develops it
according to his high ideal, his intense faith, and mystic
sentiment. He gives to the Virgin an expression of infinite
sweetness; to the angels a truly celestial charm, to the saints a
serene expression of beatitude, and to the whole scene the azure
divine character of a vision of Paradise.</p>

<p>High in the centre the Redeemer extends his right hand to add a
brilliant gem to the crown of the Virgin, who sits near him, with
hands crossed in loving reverence. A luminous golden ray from this
group engraved on the panel, forms gleaming and resplendent waves
in the background of the picture, from which groups of angels stand
out, playing all sorts of music, or dancing with hand clasped in
hand. Two are prostrated in profound admiration at the base, and
shed clouds of incense from their thuribles, while two others draw
melody from heavenly harps.</p>

<p>In the lower part of the picture are many saints, who by their
charmed faces and feeling of ineffable joy, show how delighted they
are with the vision and the heavenly music.</p>

<p>Among the works which were undoubtedly done by Fra Angelico
during his stay at Fiesole, may be ascribed several different
representations of the Last Judgment. He derived the inspiration of
the subject directly from Orcagna's fresco in Santa Maria Novella,
only Fra Angelico has created a paradise too exclusively modelled
on the monastic life. "His ideal," writes Reymond, "is a young
neophyte entirely absorbed in prayer&mdash;a contemplative being
who has renounced earthly life, abdicating his qualities as a man
to dream of nothing but the future life. Orcagna, on the contrary,
dreams of an ideal in which human life triumphs in all its fulness,
and one might say that the beings which people his Paradise are but
glorified bodies."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id=

<p>Fra Giovanni painted Hell and Paradise with small figures for
the Camaldolese monks of Santa Maria degli Angeli. This is the
picture now in the Ancient and Modern Gallery at Florence, of which
Vasari writes, "he proved the rectitude <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_78" id="Page_78">078</a></span>of his judgment in
this work, having made the countenances of the blessed beautiful
and full of a celestial gladness; but the condemned, those destined
to the pains of hell, he has depicted in various attitudes of
sorrow, and bearing the impress and consciousness of their misdeeds
and wretchedness on their faces: the blessed are seen to enter the
gate of paradise in triumphal dance, the condemned are dragged away
to eternal punishment in hell by the hands of demons."<a name=
"FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29"
class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The representation is faithful to artistic tradition. In the
highest part the Saviour calls the elect to Him with His right
hand, while with His left He motions away the reprobate: around Him
are eight winged cherubim, with whom kneeling angels below join to
form a circle. Some are adoring or praying, others hold scrolls in
their hands. On the right sits the Virgin in white robes, with
hands crossed on her breast and head gently bent: on the left St.
John Baptist with hands clasped in prayer. At the sides Patriarchs,
Apostles and Prophets, and at the extremities St. Dominic and St.
Francis. An angel holds the cross at the feet of Christ, and two
others flying, blow their trumpets towards the dead, who rise from
the open sepulchres below.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">079</a></span> In the base at the left, demons drag the damned ones
to Hell; on the right the elect cast glances of love and faith on
the Saviour, and in joyous fraternity enjoy the heavenly guerdon.
The Elysian Fields of the blessed are truly celestial, gleaming
with gold, irrigated by limpid streams, glorious with beautiful
flowerets that bloom amid the verdure, the exuberance of nature
harmonizing marvelously with the joy of the elect.</p>

<p>Less original is the representation of Hell, which is copied
straight from the fresco in the Pisan Camposanto. Not only the same
division of <i>bolge</i> (hell-pits), but even the repetition of
motives in the souls that fill them; the only and notable
difference is the figure of Lucifer which instead of being in the
centre occupies the base of the picture. At the summit "Eriton
cruda, che richiamava l'ombre a' corpi sui," is precisely in the
same attitude as in the Pisan Camposanto, a figure holding a banner
coiled around by a serpent, and near it is a simoniac with his
entrails torn out, the identical figure from the Pisan Hell. The
back view of the figure which a demon raises to throw into the jaws
of a terrible monster is also copied entire from the same
fresco.</p>

<p>The <i>bolge</i> and the damned souls which occupy them, are, as
we have said, repetitions, but with less intelligence and character
than the Pisan fresco.</p>

<p>On the left the slothful and lazy are punished; beneath them in
two <i>bolge</i> are the passionate and the gluttonous<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">083</a></span> souls,
and below again the luxurious and avaricious ones. The poverty of
conception in this "Inferno" is not even compensated by the usual
good qualities of refinement; one could almost believe that the
artist found it so repugnant to his character to depict brutality
and infernal tortures, that he hurried over this part to get rid of
it the sooner. The representation of the damned is cold, their
struggles with the demons, which at Pisa and in other places is so
full of energy, is given here with exaggerated art and becomes
ineffectual; in fact this part of the picture is void of feeling,
and confirms our previous remarks on the artistic character of the
painter.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another "Last Judgment" is in the Corsini Gallery at
Rome;&mdash;a triptych, the side panels of which represent the
"Ascension" and the "Descent of the Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>This scene is, however, much more simply designed, but cannot be
fairly judged now, on account of the retouching and frequent
varnishing which disfigure it.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">084</a></span></p>



<p>The Saviour seated on the clouds, rests his left hand on a book
which he holds upright on his knees, while the right is raised in
malediction against the sinners, with an action which recalls the
Christ in the Judgment of the Camposanto at Pisa. On the sides are
groups of angels, apostles and saints; and the elect are on the
right, the wicked on the left below them. "In the picture of the
Corsini Gallery," writes Venturi, "the representation was cramped
by the narrow limits of the central panel of the triptych. It is
evidently a reduced form of preceding compositions, for several
angels which terminate the picture above, are here seen only from
the waist downwards. The figures of the elect, loving, ecstatic and
beautiful, clad in flame-coloured robes, with stars and flowers, as
in similar compositions by Fra Angelico, are absolutely sublime,
while those of the wicked are almost</p>

and jackals, with red eyes and mouths, black bodies and clawed
feet. How much happier he is in the clear and joyful note of colour
in some figures standing before a door on the right! And how much
better we recognise his sweet spirit in the features of the blest,
with their clear eyes whose pupils are fixed trance-like under
lightly drawn eyebrows."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id=

graceful action and attitudes raise their heads to join in the

<p>Another last Judgment forms one of the thirty-five small
pictures which adorned the doors of the presses for the silver
vessels etc., in the chapel of the SS. Annunziata. It is generally
believed that he painted this during his stay at Fiesole; but as we
find it dates posterior to this, we shall speak of it later, and
must first record that in 1432 Fra Angelico painted an
"Annunciation" for the church of Sant' Alessandro at Brescia, said
to be the one on an altar to the right on entering the church. So
greatly is it transformed by restorations, that no one in looking
at it now would dream that it was by our artist, if indeed it ever
were his work. It would appear that the restorer had used other
models in repainting the Angel and the Virgin.<a name=

<p>On July 11th 1433 the contract was signed between the Consuls of
the Arte dei Linaioli (Guild of Linen Weavers) and our artist, for
the tabernacle of which they had asked Lorenzo Ghiberti to give a
design. The contract says: "We engage Fra Guido, called Fra
Giovanni of the Order of St. Dominic of Fiesole, to paint for the
said Guild, a tabernacle of Our Lady; to be painted within and
without with colours, gold, azure and silver, all of the very
finest that can be found, with all his art and diligence, and for
all this and his fatigue and work, he shall receive one hundred and
ninety gold florins, or any less sum as shall appear to his
conscience, and in consideration of the figures that are in the
design."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">090</a></span></p>

<p>This painting is now to be admired in the Uffizi Gallery where
it was placed in 1777; it is too universally known to need a minute
description. The Virgin enthroned with <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_91" id="Page_91">091-092</a></span> the Holy Child is
surrounded by twelve angels, the most lovely, graceful and
celestial that Fra Angelico ever painted. In the interior of the
side panels are St. John and St. Mark, in the exterior St. Peter
and St. Mark. The latter, as is well known, was the protector of
the Linen Guild: "therefore," says Padre Marchese, "they wished
that whether the tabernacle were open or closed, he should be
always in their sight."</p>


<p>In this work Fra Angelico shows that his style was derived from
Giotto and Orcagna, though his figures with their large heads, are
treated like miniatures and become insignificant; the result is
cold and void, precisely by reason of this over conscientious
execution.</p>

<p>The face of the Virgin lacks expression and sentiment, while the
angels depicted on the slope of the frame in act of sounding
trumpets, psalters, cymbals etc., have such a sweetness of
sentiment that they seem literally rained down from heaven.</p>

<p><img src="images/img-t.jpg" class="floatLeft" alt="T" />he church of
San Giorgio&mdash;writes Vasari&mdash;"had at this time been given
to the monks of San Domenico da Fiesole, but they did not occupy it
longer than from about the middle of July to the end of January,
because Cosimo de' Medici and Lorenzo his brother had obtained for
them, from Pope Eugenius, the church and convent of San Marco,
which had previously been occupied by Salvestrine monks, to whom
San Giorgio was given in exchange. Moreover, they (Cosimo and
Lorenzo de' Medici), being much devoted to religion, and zealous
for the divine service and worship, gave orders that the
above-named convent of San Marco<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_98" id="Page_98">098</a></span> should be entirely
rebuilt according to the design and model of Michelozzo, commanding
that it should be constructed on the most extensive and magnificent
scale, with all the conveniences that those monks could possibly
desire."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> And in the year 1436,
the said monks made their entry with pomp and solemn f&ecirc;tes,
in which the three bishops of Taranto, Treves and Parentino, took
part, preceded by the mace-bearers of the Signoria who were sent to
give greater magnificence to the scene. Fra Cipriano, Vicar general
of the new congregation of the "Osservanza," took possession of the
convent in the name of that Order.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id=
"FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class=
"fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>"The first part completed," continues the Aretian biographer,
"was that above the old refectory and opposite to the ducal
stables, which had formerly been erected by the Duke Lorenzo de'
Medici. In this place twenty cells were made, the roof was put on,
and the various articles of wood-work brought into the refectory,
which was finished as we see it in our day."<a name=
"FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39"
class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p>"The library was afterwards erected, it was vaulted above and
below, and had sixty-four bookcases of cypress <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">099</a></span>wood
filled with the most valuable books. The dormitory which was in the
form of a square, was next built, and finally the cloister was
completed, with all the other truly commodious apartments of that
convent, which is believed to be the most perfectly arranged, the
most beautiful and most convenient building of its kind that can be
found in Italy, thanks to the skill and industry of Michelozzo, who
gave it up to its occupants entirely finished in the year 1452.<a
name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Cosimo de' Medici is
said to have expended 36,000 ducats on this fabric; it is added
that while it was in course of construction, he gave the monks 366
ducats every year for their support."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id=
"FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class=
"fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>In 1439, two years after the building was begun, the principal
chapel was finished, and the work of restoring and embellishing the
church was commenced. This was completed in 1441.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the architect was engaged in restoring the church of San
Marco, Fra Giovanni was probably commissioned to <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>paint
the altar-piece for the great altar. Vasari writes of it: "But
exquisite and admirable above all is the picture of the High Altar
in that church; for besides that the Madonna in this painting
awakens devotional feeling in all who regard her, by the pure
simplicity of her expression; and that the saints surrounding her
have a similar character; the predella, in which are stories of the
martyrdom of St. Cosmo, St. Damian, and others, is so perfectly
finished, that one cannot imagine it possible for any thing to be
executed with greater care, nor can figures more delicate, or more
judiciously arranged, be conceived."<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id=
"FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class=
"fnanchor">[42]</a> Unfortunately the picture, now in the Academy
of the Belle Arti, is in such bad condition that we are not able to
confirm Vasari's judgment, for the tints have faded, in some parts
leaving the undercolouring exposed, in others it is corroded even
down to the white of the plaster ground work.</p>

<p>The Virgin is enthroned, holding on her lap the child, whose
right hand is uplifted to bless, while the left holds a globe.
Beside the throne are groups of angels, in front on the right St.
Dominic, St. Francis and St. Peter Martyr; on the left St.
Laurence, St. Paul and St. Mark; above them kneel Sts. Cosmo and
Damian, protectors of the Medici family, placed here in homage to
the liberality of the Medici towards the Order.</p>

<span class="caption">MADONNA AND CHILD WITH ANGELS AND
SAINTS.<br />
(Ancient and Modern Gallery, Florence.)</span></div>

<p>In the predella, now divided, were represented various stories
relative to the lives of Sts. Cosmo and Damian, which may be
recognised in two little pictures (Nos. 257-258, Catalogue of 1893)
at the Belle Arti, and in those now at the Gallery at Munich (Nos.
989, 990, 991).</p>

<p>In the first of the two at Florence, the saints have cut off the
leg of a sick man, and placed that of a negro in its stead. In the
second is represented their burial together with the brethren. In
those at Munich the scenes are:&mdash;the saints constrained by the
judge Lisia to sacrifice to idols; the saints thrown into the sea
and saved by angels, while the judge is liberated from two demons
by their prayers; and lastly their crucifixion, while stones and
arrows are aimed against them, but rebound on the executioners.<a
name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Other similar subjects are represented in six "stories" divided
into two panels (No. 234, Catalogue of 1893) in the Belle Arti. In
the first the saints are seen exercising the healing art without
receiving payment; they cure Palladia, who in her gratitude prays
St. Damian in the name of God to accept a gift, her brother being
wrathful not knowing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id=
"Page_103">103</a></span> the cause. In the second the judge
Lisia obliges the saints and their three brethren to sacrifice to
idols; in the third the angels save them from drowning; in the
fourth they are condemned to be burnt alive, and sing psalms in the
midst of the flames; in the fifth is the stoning; and lastly the
decapitation.</p>

<p>These works, however, do not always show equal execution,
therefore we might judge that the artist sometimes availed himself
of the hand of an assistant.</p>

<p>From the records remaining to us, it does not appear that Fra
Giovanni worked at any other pictures for his church, so it is
probable he gave all his attention to adorning the convent, which
on account of the works he has left there, may fairly be considered
one of the finest monuments of Italian art.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was not the first time that Fra Angelico had painted large
mural frescoes. As he had already shown at Fiesole his mastery in
that more minute style, which was to find more complete expression
in the Roman pictures, so the convent of San Marco gave him scope
to prove his genius also in this freer branch of art. In the
cloisters, the corridors, the cells, and the rooms in which the
monks met together, we find specimens of his artistic work, and
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span> these various pictures all his favourite personages
reappear one by one in larger proportions, but without losing that
original grace and sentiment with which his smaller works are
imbued. Indeed these show that he had studied from the life with
independence and sincerity of purpose, and could render it with
greater facility and decision.</p>

<div class="figright"><a href="images/illus110.jpg"><img src="images/illus110-tb.jpg"
style="margin-top: 1em;" width="250" alt="CHRIST ON THE CROSS." title="CHRIST ON THE CROSS." /></a><br />
<span class="caption">CHRIST ON THE CROSS.</span></div>


<p>A very noteworthy change in the character of Fra Angelico's art
may be observed in these mural paintings. He must have perceived,
after painting the tabernacle for the Linen Weavers' Guild, that a
deeper study of the real was necessary to give life to his figures,
especially when these should assume larger proportions.</p>

<p>To give intelligent expression even to dreams, visions and
ideality of thought, a material and technical part is necessary;
the mind may wander free in fantasy, through indefinite space, but
it needs a firm hand to render the conception evident; and the
clearer the expression is, the greater ability in the creation of
his works does it show in the artist. Thus Fra Angelico, placing
his figures in ideal surroundings, believed at first that refined
thought was sufficient to make a perfect picture, and he
illuminated his little figures with superficial delicacy,
surrounding them with azure and gold, and so idealized them that
they are more like diaphanous apparitions than human beings.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>But he soon learned that by merely enlarging these little
pictures, he could not succeed in giving them even that
individuality to which he was led by natural taste and mode of
life. In fact, what a difference lies between the figures of the
Linen Weavers' Tabernacle painted in 1433, and those of the picture
in the church of San Marco done in 1438! The first: void, weak and
without expression; the second: full of life and character; and
note that this difference strikes the eye even now, notwithstanding
the difficulty of comparison owing to the wretched condition to
which the panel at San Marco is reduced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>In this cloister, therefore, where the pictures
assume larger proportions and more importance, and the figures
greater character and individuality of form, more solidity of
artistic execution,&mdash;it is here we perceive that far as he
still was from the world and worldly things, yet with earnest study
and thought he had not failed to avail himself of the progressive
development of art around him to improve his style and give more
grandeur to his design.</p>

<p>We do not know whether the cause which influenced his mind was,
that in coming down to Florence from the Fiesole cloister he was
brought into more immediate contact with other styles of art, and
artists who followed a different, even opposite method. The
distance of his convent from the city was not, however, so great as
to have prevented his visiting the immortal works which enriched
Florence, or to diminish the relations of friendship or
acquaintance which he surely had formed with his greater
colleagues. In fact, Fra Angelico and Ghiberti must have already
consulted together about the Tabernacle of the Linen Guild; and the
works which the pious monk sent from Fiesole to the churches and
convents of Florence could not have been unknown there, any more
than the works of the other artists in the city were to him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>Certain changes independent of external causes
sometimes take place naturally, we might say spontaneously, in
strong artistic temperaments. Fra Angelico felt and understood as
he continued his work, that something was wanting in him before he
could succeed in giving reality to his thoughts and sentiment; he
necessarily perfected his studies, and investigated truth more
conscientiously&mdash;the result was the new style, a natural
consequence of artistic individual progress.</p>

<p>Opposite the entrance in the pretty cloister of the Florentine
convent we may admire the figure of the crucified Christ who turns
His eyes to St. Dominic kneeling below, and embracing the cross
with both hands, while raising his head to meet the glance of the
Saviour. In the five lunettes of the doors in the cloister, Fra
Angelico has represented St. Peter Martyr, St. Dominic, Christ
issuing from the sepulchre, Christ in the dress of a pilgrim, and
St. Thomas Aquinas. The figure of the crucified Saviour is nobly
beautiful in its simple and intelligent outline, firm design and
life-like colouring. That of St. Peter Martyr is full of character;
it is a half figure holding with his left hand the palm of
martyrdom and a book which he rests on his side;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> the first finger of the right hand is placed on his
mouth, indicating the silence of the cloister. St. Dominic has the
book of his rules in one hand and the discipline, or rope for
scourging in the other, as though to demonstrate that both moral
and material influence should govern a religious community. The
"Christ of the resurrection" shows His wounds, and St. Thomas
Aquinas holds his book of theology in both hands.</p>


<p>In the arch of the hospice the painter has represented two
Dominicans welcoming Christ, to remind the brethren that to offer
hospitality to the poor and the pilgrims, was the same as receiving
Christ.</p>

<p>The Redeemer with his hat hanging behind His shoulders leans on
His pilgrim's staff; one of the brethren presses His left hand, and
taking Him by the right arm invites Him to rest. The heads of the
two devotees are full of character<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span> and expression, and on
their faces beam the joy and love they feel for their unexpected
guest. The second monk who clasps the Saviour's arm with both hands
as though he can scarcely believe his own eyes, is drawn with such
natural feeling that nothing greater can be desired or
attained.</p>

<p>Equally beautiful is the pilgrim Christ with His long beard and
curls flowing on His shoulders; the whole scene in fact is given
with great nobility and exquisite grace.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">CHRIST IN PILGRIM'S DRESS.</span></div>


<p>In the chapter-house of the convent Fra Angelico repeated the
scene of the Crucifixion. Vasari writes of it thus: "Fra Giovanni
was so greatly beloved for his admirable qualities by Cosimo de'
Medici, that the latter had no sooner completed the church and
convent of San Marco, than he caused the good father to paint the
whole story of the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ on one of the walls
of the chapter-house. In this work figures of all those saints who
have been heads and founders of religious bodies, are mourning and
bewailing at the foot of the cross on one side; and on the other,
St. Mark the Evangelist beside the Mother of the Son of God, who
has fainted at sight of the crucified Saviour. Around the Virgin
are the Maries, who are sorrowing with and supporting her; they are
accompanied by the saints Cosimo and Damian.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>"Beneath this work, in a frieze above the dado the
master executed a figure of St. Dominic standing at the foot of a
tree; on the branches of which are medallions, wherein are all the
popes, cardinals, bishops, saints, and masters in theology who had
belonged to Fra Giovanni's Order of the Preaching Friars, down to
his own day."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a
href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p>In this masterly work Fra Angelico pours out with full hands the
most vivid and intense feelings of his soul, and if he does not
attain to grand dramatic power, he at least succeeds in depicting
with rare ingenuity the varied expressions of sorrow, despair, hope
and faith which animate each person, and in giving natural and
life-like character and attitude to the various heads.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Page_112a" id="Page_112a"></a><span

<span class="caption">THE CRUCIFIXION.</span></div>

<p>The group of the fainting Virgin may possibly seem conventional,
but what sweet piety is in the feeling of the other figures! St.
Dominic, devoutly kneeling, inclines his head (cleverly
foreshortened and marvellously expressed) and extends his arms to
the Redeemer; St. Zenobi (or St. Ambrose the archbishop) standing
upright, points with his right to the Saviour; St. Jerome, in
hermit's dress, bends forward and clasps his hands in prayer; St.
Augustine holds his pen in one hand, his book and pastoral staff in
the other; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id=
"Page_113">113</a></span> St. Francis brings his hand to his
brow in an attitude of melancholy indefinable sadness. The Saints
Benedict, Bernard and Romuald follow, then St. Thomas Aquinas with
a most beautiful head full of life and character (it must certainly
be a portrait, so life-like is the expression), next St. Peter
Martyr with his hands on his breast; and lastly in the foreground
an unknown monk (Padre Marchese thinks it is St. John Gualbert) who
weeps, with his left hand over his eyes.<a name="FNanchor_45_45"
id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class=
"fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>On the left of the fresco, near the swooning Virgin, stands St.
John Baptist pointing to the Saviour; St. Mark kneeling shows his
gospel; St. Laurence clasps his hands on his breast; and St. Cosmo
wrings his hands as he contemplates the Cross; while St. Damian
turns, covering his eyes, and weeping the mournful loss of the
Lord.</p>

<p>In the ornamentation of the simulated frame which surrounds the
fresco, are hexagonal spaces containing half figures of prophets
with labels, containing texts referring to the passion of Christ;
and below them on the right, the Erythrean Sibyl. In the lower part
of the frieze, are ten rounds, containing portraits of the most
illustrious members of the Dominican <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span> Order. In the centre
St. Dominic, on the left Pope Innocent V., Cardinal Ugone, Father
Paulo the Florentine, the Archbishop St. Antonino (this must surely
have been added later), the blessed ones Giordano of Saxony,
Niccol&ograve;, Remigius the Florentine and Buoninsegna the martyr.
On the right are the blessed brethren John Dominici, Peter of the
Marshes, Albertus Magnus, St. Raymond, Chiaro of Sesto, St. Vincent
Ferreri and Bernard the martyr.</p>

<p>Retouches and restorations are not wanting in this picture, the
drapery has been repainted in several parts and the background has
been smudged with that reddish colour, which, in altering the tone
of the whole fresco, has injured the limpidity of colour and
original refinement of harmony.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chronicles of the convent of San Marco record another
Crucifixion by Fra Angelico in the refectory of the monks,
"probably," writes Padre Marchese, "a replica of that which he had
already painted in the Fiesolan convent." This now no longer
exists, it appears to have been destroyed to make space for
Sogliani's great fresco of St. Dominic at table with his brethren,
when they were supplied with bread by angels. But in the cells and
dormitories of the Florentine convent Fra Angelico scattered lovely
proofs of his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id=
"Page_115">115</a></span> genius and sentiment, pouring out on
them with rare talent the most exquisite grace of his brush, and
tenderest thoughts of his soul. From the "Annunciation" to the
various scenes from the life of Christ; from the "Virgin among the
saints," in the corridor, to the decoration of the room which
Cosimo had built for himself in his favourite convent, all breathe
such sweet poesy in the grace and simplicity of the varied scenes,
that one cannot look at them unmoved.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Facing the entrance of the upper corridor of the cloister he
painted the Angel bringing the glad tidings to the Virgin. We have
already noted in regard to this subject as created by him at
Cortona, how the representation finds its greater development here,
where the artist succeeds better in rendering the feeling of
veneration on the part of the heavenly messenger, and the
submissive humility of the Virgin.</p>

<p>The same subject is repeated in a cell (No. 3), but in this
design, which breathes the same sentiment of sweetness and piety,
St. Dominic in reverent attitude is looking on.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>On the wall at the left of the entrance is a Crucifixion, with
St. Dominic on his knees, embracing the cross, the figures are
about half life size, the design similar to that which we have
already seen in the cloister, but showing less ability. Nor are
these the only Crucifixions which our artist painted. He has
reproduced the subject in several cells, always varying either the
attitude of the Saviour, or the persons who adore Him, but the
serene attitude of the Son of God is<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span> unalterable. Without
exaggerated contractions or violent action He remains fixed on the
cross, His head bowed in mute contemplation of the figures below
Him. These, on the contrary, are the prey of sorrow and despair,
they cover their faces, or weep distractedly at His feet.</p>



<p>Some of these frescoes of the Crucifixion with St. Dominic
kneeling below, may be classed as decidedly by other hands, the
execution being weak, the drawing incorrect, and the sentiment
inefficiently expressed. These variants are doubtless attributable
to the assistants he employed in their execution.</p>

<p>In the fresco representing the <i>Noli me tangere</i> Angelico
gives us a work full of freshness and life, idealized in Giottesque
style. The figure of Christ is majestic, as with a<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span> sign
He withdraws Himself from the kneeling Magdalene, who
supplicatingly extends her arms towards Him.</p>

<span class="caption">THE RISEN CHRIST.</span></div>

<p>Most lovely are the composition and feeling of the figures in
the "Nativity," where the Virgin and St. Joseph with joined hands
kneel in adoration of the Babe stretched on a heap of straw on the
ground. A little above, on the right<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span> stands St. Dominic,
and behind the Virgin on the left a female saint kneels, her hands
clasped in prayer. In the background beneath a humble shed are the
bull and the ass, and four adoring angels above.</p>

<p>In the "Transfiguration on Mount Tabor" the figure of the
ascending Christ with outstretched arms and noble features is one
of Fra Angelico's best works, but the attitudes of the Apostles are
conventional; the kneeling figure on the left with hands upraised
to express confusion and surprise at the resurrection, is too
mannered, and by its pose and action disturbs the serene harmony of
the picture.</p>

<p>In the "Institution of the Holy Sacrament," Fra Angelico, in
true Giottesque style, represented the Apostles at the mystic
feast, and Christ giving them the consecrated <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
wafer, while He holds the chalice in His left hand. Here the
figures of the disciples admirably express varied feelings of
devotion and joy in receiving the divine food from the hand of the
Master. But the fresco which surpasses all, in nobility of line and
simple grandeur of conception, is the "Coronation of the
Virgin."</p>

<p>Christ and the Virgin are seated in glory above the light
clouds, the Son places the celestial crown on the head of the
Mother who humbly bows her whole form towards Him, with hands
crossed on her bosom. Her face is irradiated by an ineffable and
heavenly smile, the supreme expression of happiness; the drapery of
both is white and delicate, enveloping the limbs with well defined
folds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122-123</a></span>The figures without being ineffectual, indeed they
are even forcible, yet appear aerial apparitions, and veritable
visions of divinity. Six saints in ecstasy assist at the triumph,
St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Paul, St. Dominic, St. Francis, St. Peter
Martyr and St. Benedict, three on the right and three on the left,
in a semicircular composition, all in attitudes of contemplative
ecstasy.</p>

<p>The frescoes of the Maries at the Sepulchre, may also be
considered one of our artist's masterpieces. The risen Christ
emerges to half His figure from the clouds which envelop Him, while
the holy women contemplate the empty sepulchre, and the angel
seated in it points out the miracle which has happened. Other
scenes worthy of notice are the "Presentation in the Temple,"
"Christ in Hades," and the "Buffeting of the Saviour," and "The
Prayer in the Garden."<br /><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p>In one of the last cells, the "Crucifixion" is reproduced in a
new manner, which represents Christ having ascended the ladder and
offering Himself to death: His Mother faints at his feet in the
arms of Mary Magdalene.</p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>Marchese asserts that this composition was inspired
by a legend of St. Mary Magdalene in the language of the 14th
century. "And I thought that Messer Ges&ugrave;, ascended the cross
by a ladder voluntarily, offering His hands and feet. A centurion
who was afterwards saved saw the deed, and like a wise man he said
within himself, oh, what a marvel is here! that this prophet
appears to willingly place himself on the Cross, neither murmuring
nor resisting! And while he stood admiring, Messer Ges&ugrave; had
ascended sufficiently high, and turning on the ladder opened His
kingly arms, and extended His hands to those who were waiting to
nail them."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>Lastly in the room which Cosimo de' Medici had prepared for his
own use in the convent and where he often talked with the Prior Fra
Antonino, Fra Angelico painted an "Adoration of the Magi." As Pope
Eugene IV. slept in this room when he came to Florence in 1442 to
assist at the consecration of the church, it is probable that this
Adoration allusive to the Epiphany, at which time the consecration
took place, was painted at that epoch.</p>

<p>The fresco, rich in figures and beauty, is executed with real
mastery. The personages of the royal cort&egrave;ge vary in type
and character, in expression and sentiment, showing the great pains
our artist had taken in the painting of this important work, which
now, unhappily restored and injured, only allows us to guess at the
wonderful beauty with which it was once filled.</p>

<p>We see his own hand more completely in the fresco in the
corridor representing the Virgin enthroned, with the child seated
on her knee and several saints at the sides. On the right are St.
Paul, St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Laurence, and St. Peter Martyr; on
the left St. Mark, St. Cosmo and St. Damian, and St. Dominic,
holding an open book where it is written: <i>Caritatem habete;
humilitatem servate; paupertatem voluntariam possidete.
Maledictionem Dei et meam imprecor possessiones inducenti in meo
Ordine</i>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>This painting, one of the most perfect in the
convent, is one of Angelico's best, and shows what a high degree of
ability he had reached. The gentle head of the Virgin bends down to
look at her Son with the golden curls, whose face with sparkling
eyes breathes an infantile grace. The execution is accurate, the
figures well designed, full of character, nobility and life; the
delicacy of tone, just balance of composition and freshness of
colouring, are mingled with the most profound sentiment and
intimate knowledge of truth.</p>

<p>Rio thinks this fresco was done while Fra Angelico was in
Tuscany after 1450; his adieu, as it were, to his brethren; a last
legacy to that devout household with whom he had shared joys and
sorrows, and from which he was about to be separated. There is
nothing to refute this; but it appears to us that he who had
painted the great Crucifixion of the chapter-house might well have
done at the same time this fresco. It is a compendium of all his
technical qualities and feeling, and demonstrates how little by
little he succeeded, while still preserving his own spirit, in
reaching the real in art, and giving it life in a manner all his
own. But in comparing the pictures of the chapel of Pope Nicholas
V. in Rome, with this fresco, we cannot avoid noticing in those a
greater freedom of composition and grouping of the figures,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span> a greater majesty of design, a truth and depth of
observation, not recognisable in any of his earlier works, nor even
in the large Crucifixion, which is justly considered one of the
pious monk's best works.</p>

<p><img src="images/img-t.jpg" class="floatLeft" alt="T" />he
enthusiasm aroused by Fra Angelico's pictures, caused a vivid
desire amongst the various religious orders of the city, to possess
some work of his; Dominicans, Vallombrosians, Chartreuse monks, and
the Camaldolese of Santa Maria degli Angeli, vied with each other,
and all in turn obtained some of his admirable creations.</p>

<p>Among the panels painted by Fra Giovanni for the Florentine
churches and convents, the one which excels all for intensity of
sentiment and sincerity of expression is the "Deposition from the
Cross," once in the Sacristy of<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span> Santa Trinit&agrave;,
and now in the Ancient and Modern Gallery, a panel "in which,"
writes Vasari, "he put so much care that we may class it among the
best things he ever did."</p>

<p>The disciples with loving reverence let down from the Cross,
which occupies the centre of the composition, the body of the
Saviour. His face, drooping on the left shoulder, breathes a
sorrowful calm, and divine serenity which death itself could not
destroy. The nude is intelligently rendered, in nobility of form,
softness of line, and transparency and morbidity of colouring. On
the left stands a group of women; St. Mary Magdalene kisses the
feet of Christ; the Virgin contemplates Him in a trance of sadness;
on the right the disciples discuss the melancholy drama among
themselves, while below, a kneeling saint holds his right hand to
his breast and extends the left in a sorrowful wonder. In the
background is a hilly landscape with the Holy City on the left, and
Mount Calvary which the artist "with poetic and devout conceit,"
writes Marchese, "has drawn adorned with grass and flowers, as
though to denote that at the touch of the feet and precious blood
of Jesus Christ, the bare heights were reclad in rich and verdant
beauty. Although marred by restoration&mdash;for the eye is
offended by the inharmonious contrast of tints, the effect of
unskilful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span> retouching,&mdash;we may consider this painting as
one of the most beautiful works which Fra Angelico has left us.
Grandeur and simplicity are marvellously blended with freshness of
colour, and correctness of design with most intense expression and
pure sentiment."</p>

<p>The landscape in the background shows the usual defects of
perspective, but the mountains shade off delicately against the
distant blue of the sky, the plain is illuminated with infinite
flowerets, and a rich verdure clothes the summit of the sacred
hill. In the pilasters of the frame are small figures of Saints,
some of the best and finest that Fra Angelico ever painted, and in
the gables above the three arches Lorenzo Monaco has represented
the "Noli me tangere," the "Resurrection," and the "Maries at the
Sepulchre."</p>

<p>Here the question naturally arises: Why should Lorenzo Monaco
have limited his work solely to the three little scenes in the
gables of the frame, while Fra Angelico has given us the beautiful
little figures of the pilasters which show all his peculiar grace
and refinement? Why did an artist capable of producing those
admirable saints, leave to Fra Lorenzo Monaco the office (all the
worse if he had been, as some say, his master) of finishing the
work with only those three insignificant little scenes? And can we
suppose that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id=
"Page_136">136</a></span> Fra Lorenzo Monaco, already at the
apex of his fame, should accept, and, still more strange, be
content with a secondary part in Fra Giovanni's work?</p>

<p>The answer is more simple than it at first appears. There is no
doubt that the scenes in the Gothic gables are the work of the
Camaldolese monk, and as we cannot logically infer that they were
specially painted by him for Fra Angelico's picture, we must
suppose, and indeed firmly believe them to have been added at a
later time. In fact, the form of the foliated Gothic decoration
lacks character and does not harmonize with the pilasters which
clearly show, too, a subsequent adaptation of the frame. The
finials of the pilasters do not match the style of the gables, in
fact it is clear that the Gothic ornamentation, taken from some
painting by Lorenzo Monaco, was at a more recent date adapted to
Fra Angelico's altar-piece.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fra Giovanni painted a panel picture of the "Dead Christ" for
the "Compagnia del Tempio" in Florence; this is now in the Ancient
and Modern Gallery, having been placed there in 1786, after the
suppression of that Company.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src=
"images/illus146.jpg" width="800"  height="515" alt=" THE DEAD CHRIST." title="" /><br />
 <span class="caption">THE DEAD CHRIST.</span></div>

<p>Rio supposes that the enthusiasm aroused by the great <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span> Deposition in Santa Trinit&agrave;, tempted the
Company to covet the possession of a similar one.<a name=
"FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47"
class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>Only two figures, however, are common to the two paintings: one
is the St. Simeon kneeling in the left corner who, in this second
picture, is represented as a younger man than in the first; the
other is a figure a little behind him, which is a reproduction of
that one in the large Deposition with a hood on his head, who is
speaking to the disciple below him, as he entrust to him the body
of the Saviour;&mdash;a figure which Milanesi believes to be a
portrait of the architect Michelozzo.</p>

<p>If this be indeed Fra Angelico's friend the Florentine
architect, we may admit Cartier's assertion that this panel is a
sequel of the larger Descent from the Cross, and may have been
painted at the same time.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id=
"FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class=
"fnanchor">[48]</a> But these are things which we dare not affirm
with any certainty, as we entertain doubts regarding the greater or
less authenticity of writers on the subject of Michelozzo's
portrait.</p>

<p>Besides many figures of saints, the painter has introduced those
of St. Dominic and the Beata Villana, because the Company of the
Temple had ancient rights over the relics
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
of this good woman which are preserved in the Dominican church
of Santa Maria Novella. The other figures, though expressing divers
feelings of sorrow and lively sympathy, have nothing in common with
the famous Deposition either in character or technique and the
picture does not reach the usual perfection.</p>

<p>Even the type of the Christ differs remarkably in the two
paintings, so much so that no comparison can be instituted, or
resemblance found between them; moreover, the panel of the Temple
Company is badly spoilt by restoration, and the colouring is so
altered that it is almost black in some parts.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>"In the Chapel of the SS. Annunziata at Florence which Piero di
Cosimo de' Medici caused to be built, Fra Angelico painted the
doors of the presses where the silver plate is kept, with little
figures executed with great diligence."<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id=

<p>Padre Marchese writes: "I believe it was in Fiesole that he
painted many of those little panels, which may now be <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span> seen
in the Gallery of the Florentine Academy of Design, and perhaps
also the doors of the presses for the silver vessels in the chapel
of the SS. Annunziata at Florence. In his first edition Vasari had
enumerated them among his early works, which may have seemed
probable, as Fra Angelico's first steps in art were in illuminating
and painting small stories."<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id=
"FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class=
"fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>But as it was only in 1448 that Piero de' Medici, to show his
devotion to the Virgin of the Annunciation, obtained from the monks
the patronage of that altar with the intention of adorning it with
a splendour worthy of the dignity of Her to whom it was
dedicated,<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> we cannot suppose that
Fra Angelico painted the door of its treasure presses before that
time.</p>

<p>Rio also dates at the epoch of the monk's sojourn in Tuscany
towards 1450, the great unfinished painting now in the Academy of
the Belle Arti, which has been regarded as one of Fra Angelico's
first works. We know as a fact that in 1450 he was prior of the
convent at Fiesole, and may believe that he stayed some time in
Tuscany, before returning to Rome to finish the chapel of Pope
Nicholas V.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a
href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> But Rio adds that
"besides the date of the building of the chapel, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>the
fact that the portrait of Michelozzo represents him as older in
this work than in the Deposition," suggests for this cyclic
composition an approximative date, very far from that assigned to
it previously.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a
href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>We must not forget, however, that several doubts arise as to the
identity of the person representing Michelozzo.</p>

<p>Vasari recognises him in that old Nicodemus with a hood, who
lowers the Christ from the cross in the Deposition, while Milanesi,
asserting that Nicodemus has a saint's aureole not a cowl, holds
that the portrait of Michelozzo is to be seen in the figure with a
black hood who speaks with the disciple beneath him as he gives the
body of the Lord into his hands. Certainly Milanesi has good reason
to doubt Vasari's assertion, as Nicodemus has no hood: moreover
Vasari himself in his second edition of the Lives (1568) assigns as
the architect's likeness that very figure with a cowl who is
speaking to the disciple. Therefore we must admit that the Aretian
Historian was mistaken either in his indication of the figure, or
in the reproduction of it as a headpiece to his Life of
Michelozzo.</p>

<div class="figleft"><a href="images/illus153b.jpg"><img src="images/illus153b-tb.jpg"

<span class="caption">THE SLAUGHTER OF THE INNOCENTS.</span></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>In any case, a similar figure to that in the
"Deposition," and with the same head-gear, again appears a little
older in the fresco of the convent of San Marco representing the
"Adoration of the Magi"; also in another picture of the
"Presentation in the Temple"; and in the little square with a
"Flight into Egypt", on one of the doors of SS. Annunziata. If
Michelozzo be really portrayed here, we must conclude that the
Deposition was painted long before 1442, and the press doors about
the same time, or a little later; but the student must take into
account the curious fact that in the "Deposition" the disciple who
talks to the man with a cowl above him, has also a certain
resemblance to the supposed Michelozzo, and that Nicodemus
reappears as St. John Baptist on the left of the large altar-piece
painted for the church of San Marco, as well as in the picture of
the dead Christ, and also as the kneeling King who kisses<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span> the feet of the Babe in the fresco of the
"Adoration of the Magi."</p>


<p>Therefore, without giving great importance to the question of
the true portrait of Michelozzo, we find that these heads, whether
of Nicodemus or the hooded disciple, are represented in various
pictures by our artist, modified by age, so that from them we may
establish the succession of the different works, i. e. first the
"Dead Christ" of the Company of the Temple, next the picture at San
Marco (1438), then the "Deposition," and lastly the fresco in San
Marco, and the little "Annunciation." Thus all these works would
certainly date during Fra Angelico's stay in Florence.</p>

<span class="caption">CORONATION OF THE VIRGIN.</span></div>


<p>But to return to the doors of the presses in the SS. Annunziata,
it is true, as Rio writes, that instead of being a series of
subjects for future frescoes or altar-pieces, the "stories" seem a
hasty resum&eacute;, often too hasty, of works already painted in
the convent of San Marco or other places. Some of them are
noticeable for firmness of design and vigour of colouring, others
instead are unworthy of the master and evidently show another
hand.</p>

<p>To give this great work its due appreciation we must take it as
a whole, as the profound genius of Fra Angelico had<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
conceived it. Wishing to give it the unity of a dramatic poem, he
placed at the beginning and at the end, like a prologue and an
epilogue, two symbolic figures, in the last of which the seven
branched candlestick serves as a support to the Old and New
Testaments.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a
href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>




<p>We may enumerate among the best scenes the "Flight into Egypt,"
the "Slaughter of the Innocents," the "Betrayal of Judas," the
"Dead Christ," and the "Resurrection of Lazarus," all composed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span> in Giottesque style: but, when we think of the
progress of Fra Angelico in art as shown in the frescoes in San
Marco, and his best panel paintings, we cannot avoid noticing a
certain want of vigour in these presses.</p>

<p>Having become accustomed to the grander methods of fresco
painting, in which his talent and ability found greater scope for
expression,&mdash;even though not attaining to the ease and force
of some of his contemporaries and followers,&mdash;Fra Angelico
must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span> now found himself at the disadvantage, natural to
one who, after moving free in wider space, is suddenly cramped into
narrower confines. This explains why we find in some of these small
panels, greater conventionality in the representation of scenes and
action, and less ease and correctness of execution. We might add
also, that many of them, where these defects are especially
evident, may be ascribed to other hands, less clever than his own,
those of his assistants who were called in to expedite the work and
assist the artist.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rio believes that two of Angelico's paintings, one of which was
once in the Dominican monastery of San Vincenzo d'Annalena, and the
other in that of the Frati dell'Osservanza in Mugello, but now both
at the Belle Arti, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id=

<p>We cannot, however, accept the assertion of the French critic.
These two pictures, though utterly different in character and type,
too forcibly recall his previous works. And as according to the
same author the altar-piece of the monks <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>of the Mugello
resembles the other in colouring, technique, the freer style of
drapery, the type of the Virgin and character of the figures, we
might reasonably conclude that both paintings belong to the period
of his residence at Fiesole or Florence, i. e. previous to his
departure for Rome in 1445.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are even less inclined to endorse the opinion of Rio in
regard to the date of the painting from the Annalena Convent. The
internal organization of the convent was only regulated by a bull
of Pope Nicholas V. after 1450, so there is probably no connection
between the internal establishment of the convent and the
Commission for the picture.</p>

<p>The convent (it is well to remember) was founded in 1453, but
the religious intentions of Anna Elena Malatesta met with no slight
resistance, and it was not till 1455, that Pope Calixtus III.
conceded her permission to "build in her house a public oratory in
which mass should be celebrated and the divine Offices performed."
We cannot then admit that the picture was specially painted for the
convent named<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a
href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
after that saintly lady. When one reflects that Anna Elena
Malatesta, foundress of the monastery, was educated in the house of
Attilio di Vieri de' Medici, and was by Cosimo Pater Patri&aelig;
married to Baldaccio of Anghiari, it is not unlikely that the
picture had been a commission from Cosimo, and that when Annalena
was left a widow, and took the vows in 1441, it was offered by him
to the convent, to which the sad widow had consecrated all her
care. It is the more probable, that it was painted for the Medici,
because the two patron saints of their house are represented in
it.</p>

<p>SS. Cosmo and Damian only appear in the pictures painted by Fra
Angelico in Florence, probably in recognition of the benefits
bestowed by Cosimo on the monks of San Marco; moreover, we do not
think the work could have been done at Fiesole after the first
visit to Rome in 1452, because the figures, weak in chiaro-scuro,
are still treated as if they were enlarged miniatures, and do not
show the character of his later works. On the other hand the
picture of the Osservanza in Mugello displays the whole power of
the artist, and may be compared, as Rio says, to the panel at San
Marco both in the character of the figures and the larger style of
treatment.</p>

<p>Vasari cites other works which have unfortunately been dispersed
or destroyed, among which were an altar-piece in<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span> the
Certosa at Florence, representing the "Virgin and Child," with some
angels below, and at the sides St. Laurence, St. Zenobi, and St.
Benedict; the "Coronation of the Madonna," once in the lunette of
the Acciajoli chapel: another with the "Virgin and two saints,"
painted "con azzurri oltramarini bellissimi," (with beautiful
ultramarine blues): and the pictures in the dividing wall of Santa
Maria Novella opposite the choir. The "Annunciation," which
according to Vasari was in the church of San Francesco at San
Miniato, and which Milanesi believes to be in the Museum of Madrid,
is instead now in the National Gallery at London. It is a diptych,
in one panel the archangel Gabriel, with golden wings outspread,
crossing his hands on his breast bows before the Virgin, who in the
other panel leans forward to listen to his blessed word. The scene
is in a cloister, from the arches of which a field of flowers is
seen, and in the distant horizon the outlines of the Apennine
mountains. A great lily blossoms beside the Virgin, the two
capitals of the columns of the cloister have the Albizzi arms
carved on them.</p>

<p>"This good Father painted so many pictures for the houses of the
citizens of Florence, that one wonders how one man could so
perfectly execute even in many years all that he has done." So
writes Vasari, and indeed a complete<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_153" id="Page_153">153-155</a></span> list of his
paintings still existing in Italy and elsewhere would be too long;
those we have illustrated will, however, suffice to give a good
idea of his artistic genius, and the sentiment with which this
gentle artist could represent the marvellous visions of a soul in
love with heaven!</p>

and various labours&mdash;writes Vasari&mdash;"having rendered the
name of Fra Giovanni illustrious throughout all Italy, he was
invited to Rome by Pope Nicholas V., who caused him to adorn the
chapel of the palace, where the pontiff is accustomed to hear mass,
with a "Deposition from the Cross," and with certain events from
the life of San Lorenzo, which are admirable."<a name=
"FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57"
class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>But Vasari errs in giving to Nicholas V. the merit of having
called Fra Angelico to Rome; he is also mistaken <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span> in
affirming that the artist was offered the archbishopric of
Florence, and on his modest refusal Sant' Antonino was proposed to
the Pope: "and because Fra Giovanni appearing to the Pope to be, as
he really was, a person of most holy life, gentle and modest, the
archbishopric of Florence having then become vacant, he judged him
worthy of that preferment."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id=
"FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class=
"fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>It was instead Pope Eugene IV., who wishing to embellish the
Vatican with pictures, invited Fra Angelico to Rome in 1445, having
admired his sanctity of life, and talent in art when in Florence.
That Pope died the following year, but in his successor Nicholas
V., Fra Angelico found another sincere admirer and friend, and he
remained in Rome to finish the works he had begun. He painted two
chapels in the Vatican, the one of the Sacrament for Eugene IV.,
the other for Pope Nicholas V., whose name it still bears. The
former was pulled down by Pope Paul III. to improve the
staircase.</p>

<p>"In this work," says Vasari, "which was an excellent one, Fra
Giovanni had in his own admirable manner painted stories in fresco
from the life of Christ, and had introduced many portraits of
eminent persons then living. These portraits would most probably
have been lost to us, had not <span class='pagenum'><a name=

the following among them to be preserved for his Museum: Pope
Nicholas V., the Emperor Frederick, who had at that time arrived in
Italy; Fra Antonino, who afterwards became Archbishop of Florence;

"FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59"
class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is probable that after having finished the chapel of the
Sacrament, and before the new commission was given by Nicholas V.,
Fra Angelico&mdash;by means of Don Francesco di Barone of Perugia,
a Benedictine monk and celebrated master of glass
painting&mdash;entered into negotiation with the Operai and Consuls
of the Duomo at Orvieto, to paint the chapel of the Madonna di San
Brizio. But before he accepted the commission he gave them to
understand that he could only go to Orvieto in the months of June,
July and August, when he did not wish to remain in Rome.</p>

<p>"He demanded 200 gold ducats a year, together with all expenses
of board and lodging, colours and scaffolding; besides seven ducats
a month for his assistant, and two for his boy. The contract was
signed on these conditions by Messer Enrico Monaldeschi, the
principal citizen&mdash;almost <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span> the tyrant&mdash;of
Orvieto, who always took a personal part in the most important
events of the city. Fra Angelico took with him Benozzo di Lese,
Giovanni di Antonio da Firenze, and Iacomo di Poli, with whose
assistance he commenced the painting in the large lunettes on June
15th 1447. Pietro di Niccola of Orvieto was also employed. They
painted together for three months and a half, but Fra Angelico did
not return the following year.</p>

<p>"As the summer of 1449 drew near, the overseers, who were left
with only Pietro Baroni, a proved artist, endeavoured to persuade
Fra Angelico to go back again, and join Baroni, saying that if he
failed them, they would prefer to postpone the work, as they looked
more to the beauty than the expense, as they always had been
accustomed to do. When every hope of obtaining Fra Angelico was
lost, they gave Benozzo Gozzoli a trial to continue Fra Giovanni's
frescoes,"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> but the effect was not
happy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/illus170.jpg"><img  src="images/illus170-tb.jpg" width="501"  height="550" alt="THE PROPHETS." title="" /></a><br />
<span class="caption">THE PROPHETS.</span></div>

<p>Fra Angelico painted in the roof of the chapel a "Christ in
Judgment," surrounded by a "glory" of angels. Sixteen saints and
prophets are seated on clouds with the motto: <i>Prophetarum
laudabilis numerus</i>. The Saviour in a circle <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span> of
light raises His right hand on high, while the left supports a
globe on His knees. On both sides are groups of angels in varied
attitudes of adoration. The prophets stand out in pyramidal groups
on a background of gold, and are either reading or meditating with
religious calm. Rosini judges the Christ to be the work of Benozzo
Gozzoli, because it seems inferior to the prophets, which show a
grander treatment and better execution. "I think," he writes, "that
the prophets alone belong to Fra Angelico; the Christ in glory, and
the remainder to Benozzo and the others. I am led to this not only
by their different style, but the heads of the prophets, although
they are disposed one above the other, as the space demands, show
the more dignified style, and perfect execution of the Florentine
monk. That perfection ought to be seen also in the Christ, which
seems to me to be a little inferior to them."<a name=
"FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61"
class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>But even while admitting that the features of the Saviour have
in some parts the characteristics of Benozzo's style, we must not
forget that he derived from his master both his good and bad
points, and from the latter especially originated those peculiar
defects, which are greatly emphasized in Benozzo's works. Hence it
is natural that something of the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span> scholar's manner
should appear in that face, but it is no proof that he has worked
at it. On the contrary it is enough to prove the impossibility of
ascribing this figure to him, to glance at the head of Christ in
Benozzo's fresco in the church of St. Francis at Montefalco,
representing the meeting of St. Francis and St. Dominic. High up on
the left the Saviour raises His right hand and the Virgin kneels at
His feet. Now all the figures are absolutely wanting in dignity and
character, especially the downcast head of Christ, with its
projecting forehead and receding chin, which is absolutely vulgar.
Here Benozzo has not even distantly remembered any of his master's
noble representations of the Saviour. Therefore not only had he no
part in that figure at Orvieto, but neither could he have done the
prophets, for they are far superior to the Christ. Finally, it is
not probable that Fra Angelico, with the feeling which inspired his
work, should entrust to an assistant the execution of such an
important figure as the Christ.</p>

<p>Even though the figure of the Christ is not to be compared to
the finest of the prophets, yet we find in the countenance the same
characteristics as the other heads display. True, it looks worse
than it really is, for a crack in the roof has damaged the mouth
and beard, and the fresco has besides suffered in the restorer's
hands.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>It is a known fact, that a few months after Fra
Angelico left, it was necessary to repair the roof of the chapel in
which he had worked, on account of the rain that percolated there,
to the great detriment of the paintings.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is certain that the heads of the
prophets have sweetness of expression and nobility of character,
and all the figures are remarkable for their fine form, dignified
attitudes, free and simple draperies, combined with bright and
vivid colouring. These qualities are not so visible in the
compartment of our Lord and the adoring angels, which may with more
certainty be attributed to Benozzo.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fra Angelico returned to Rome on the 28th of September in that
year (1447) and never went back to Orvieto, but his reasons for
breaking his contract and leaving a work incomplete are not
explained.</p>

<p>Perhaps he perceived the difficulties of the composition and was
arrested by the terrifying dread&mdash;which his character and
feeling would have magnified&mdash;of painting a Last Judgment in
such grand proportions. Or he may have had an intuition, that his
work would never be worthy of that famous building, especially as
he was called on to depict the punishments of hell and the various
feelings of sorrow, passion and despair in the damned souls,
sentiments so foreign to his<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span> own nature. Or
possibly the desire to finish the paintings entrusted to him in
Rome by the new Pontiff Nicholas V., induced him to break his
contract. In the absence of more precise records it is difficult to
establish the truth.</p>

<p>Certain it is that Fra Angelico left Orvieto for Rome and that
he painted there a "Studio" or Chapel for Nicholas V., for which
the payment is entered in a register dated 1449, but "after this
year," writes M&uuml;ntz, "we find no more traces of the
illustrious Dominican, in the books of the secret treasury."<a
name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>On January 10th 1452 Fra Angelico is again at Fiesole as prior
of his convent, and in the same year the rulers of the Commune of
Prato employed the good offices of Archbishop Antonino to induce
Fra Angelico to paint the principal chapel of their church; but he
refused, and the commission was given to Filippo Lippi.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact that the name of the Dominican artist has not been
found in the registers of the Vatican Treasury after 1449, need not
necessarily be taken as a proof that he was not working in the
Chapel of Nicholas V. at a later date. Indeed, as he went no more
to Orvieto, and would not undertake to paint the Choir of the Prato
Cathedral, it seems probable that he should have gone back to Rome
to finish his work there. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166"
id="Page_166">166</a></span> The chapel which preserves these
precious frescoes by Angelico may be considered one of the most
famous monuments of Italian art.</p>

<p>On three of the walls, he has represented in two lines of
frescoes the Vocation, the Apostleship, and the Martyrdom of St.
Stephen and St. Laurence. On the first side St. Stephen receives
the Communion from St. Peter, and distributes alms to the poor: on
the second are his preaching and justification before the high
priest: in the third his lapidation. Below on the first wall is the
consecration of St. Laurence, and his almsgiving to the poor and
maimed; second, his imprisonment and the conversion of the jailer;
and lastly his martyrdom.</p>

<p>The design is free and firm, yet keeping true to the character
of the artist. The execution is more accurate and equal; although
less realistic than that of Masaccio, yet he succeeds in giving his
figures a greater grace and softer expression, indeed, the
sentiment with which he imbues his figures, was never reached by
any other artist, and that sentiment is here more admirably
expressed than in any other of his works.</p>

<p>Whether St. Stephen be kneeling in wrapt devotion to take the
chalice, or with the love of divine charity giving money to the
woman, while the little child gives him its <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>hand;
whether touching his thumb he seems to explain some religious
question, while some women seated there hang on his words, exchange
their impressions, or ecstatically clasp their hands in sign of
admiration or faith; whether he speak before the Great Council, or
is conducted at last torture, supporting it with faith and
resignation;&mdash;his noble figure always inspires a feeling of
profound piety, of serene calm and personal devotion.</p>

<p>Although the representation of buildings is still too fantastic,
the perspective is not neglected as in some other works. In the
"Ordination of St. Stephen," the design of the interior of the
church is in good architectural style, but the canopy above the
altar is so low in proportion to the figure of St. Peter, that if
he were to rise to his full height he could not stand at the altar;
in another the open space in which St. Stephen is preaching has a
fortress on the right, and a palace of very doubtful character in
the background. The details of ornamentation, however, are very
carefully designed, the motives of the decoration being refined and
elegant. The pilasters with their pretty candelabra and capitals
rich with sculpture, combine so harmoniously with the purer
architectural forms, as to produce a most pleasing effect and show
the result of his studies among the numberless remains of ancient
Rome.</p>

<span class="caption">POPE SIXTUS II CONSIGNS THE TREASURES OF THE
CHURCH TO ST. LAURENCE.</span></div>

<p>The St. Laurence series is not less beautiful. It is marvellous
that Fra Angelico could express motives so analogous to the former
set of frescoes without repeating himself. Sixtus II., drawn with
the lineaments of Nicholas V., consecrates to the diaconal office
St. Laurence, who reverently kneeling extends both hands to receive
the sacramental cup. Around them are some fine figures of
ecclesiastics, who, robed in magnificent vestments, assist at the
ceremony, together with deacons and acolytes, who hold the book and
censer. There is, it is true, a great sameness in the heads, which
suggests that most of them were studied from the same model.</p>

<p>In another fresco, the Pope consigns the treasures of the church
to the saint, while a monk turns brusquely round at the noise made
at the door by two soldiers who come to conduct St. Laurence to
martyrdom. But where Fra Angelico has best succeeded in fully
rendering his sentiment, is in the painting which represents the
distribution of alms. Angelico evidently delights in the thought of
the inner satisfaction of the saint, and the happiness of the
recipients; and the sincere and serene joy transfused in the
countenances of the different figures is expressed with unusual
ability and extraordinary truth to nature.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>He has enlivened the severity of the scene by the
episode of two children, who are laughingly struggling over a piece
of money received. Infantile grace and content breathe in their
features, though slightly disturbed by the doubt which of them will
remain possessor of the precious gift.</p>

<p>The two last frescoes are very attractive and equally admirable.
One represents the condemnation of St. Laurence, the other his
martyrdom. The study of classic art is still more manifest in these
than in the others, for not only the architecture, but even the
niches which contain statues are imitated from the antique.</p>

<p>In the "Condemnation" the Emperor Decius wears a cuirass with a
toga over it fastened on the right shoulder, as in the ancient
imperial busts. His sceptre is terminated by a little idol, and
above his throne is the Roman eagle with outspread wings, in a
garland of bay leaves: in the other fresco the statues appear to be
reproductions of ancient Roman monuments. But unfortunately this
last picture has been so injured and restored that we cannot fully
appreciate its value.</p>

<p>The execution of these pictures is really remarkable. Fra
Angelico, as we have said, without losing his fundamental
qualities, has acquired and here reveals new qualities; the four
Evangelists among the clouds on a background of blue, dotted with
golden stars, are noble and full of character; the figures of the
saints on the simulated pilasters, and at the corners of each side
of the chapel, might be classed among Fra Angelico's best. Who does
not remember above the rest the fine and noble figure of St.
Bonaventure, with his flowing white beard, thoughtful eyes, and an
aspect of goodness and seriousness combined that is quite
enchanting? What other figure, however beautiful, can show such
just proportions, solid form, and majestic design, such a strong
character and expression as this? The saint's<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
thoughtful gaze is turned to the left, his mouth lightly indicating
a smile, or rather the sweet expression of innate goodness, the
marvellously drawn hands support an open book which rests on his
side. Here Fra Angelico reveals his skill in all its fulness; and
when we reflect on his advanced age, we can only remain in admiring
surprise before the freshness of his creative power, and the force
of his execution.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have documental evidence that Benozzo Gozzoli assisted his
master in these frescoes, and doubtless we may attribute to him the
fine decorations, where roses bud amidst flowers and foliage of
every kind, and garlands are resting on pretty little children's
heads, or are festooned on medallions bearing the tiara, and
crossed keys of Nicholas V.; but we cannot give him the merit of
having beautified the scenes of the "Preaching of St. Stephen," or
"St. Laurence distributing alms."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id=

MARTYRDOM.</span></div>

<p>We admit the probability that Benozzo may have executed some of
the figures, but there is a difference between this and supposing
that he had any conspicuous part in the <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>compositions,
especially in the St. Laurence series, which we cannot believe. If
the whole scene were indeed by Benozzo, would not the difference of
hand between master and scholar be more strikingly evident? And the
more so, as the scholar had not yet reached mastery of technique,
and his early frescoes show a certain crudeness, want of harmony
and incorrectness of design, which far remove them from the proved
technical ability of his master. Nor can we believe that he timidly
followed the lines traced on the walls by Fra Angelico, for even in
that case something peculiar to himself must have been clearly
perceptible in them. Now this, to speak frankly, is not
evident.</p>

<p>None of the women assisting at the preaching of St. Stephen
recall the characteristic type of those which Benozzo painted in
the frescoes at Montefalco. The saint's listeners have regular
features, and remind one of the various female figures in the San
Marco frescoes ("Resurrection of Christ" and "Prayer on the Mount
of Olives"). Benozzo's handling is less solid, his outlines are
hard and sharp, colouring crude and chiaroscuro weak; in the
stories of St. Laurence we find instead, and in a very high degree,
the solidity and correctness which we have admired in Fra
Angelico's Florentine paintings.</p>

<p>It suffices to recall the "Adoration of the Magi," in San Marco,
one of his last works before leaving for Rome,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span> and
the beautiful prophets at Orvieto; in both these pictures we meet
with the same types and figures as in the Roman frescoes,
especially in those representing "St. Peter ordaining St. Stephen,"
"St. Laurence distributing alms," and "St. Stephen before the high
priest." Without then following up doubtful suppositions, it does
not seem admissible that Fra Angelico, old as he was, should have
ceded to his pupil either the direction, or the greater part of
works of such importance, which it was greatly to his interest to
finish with the utmost care and perfection.</p>

<p>Cavalcaselle remarks that the severity of the Orvietans who
would not let Benozzo finish the work which Fra Angelico had left
incomplete, is inexplicable; but we must remember that though
Benozzo imitated his master's style, the inferiority of his talent
was always apparent in the common types, false anatomy, and
mistaken proportions of his figures. "He does not equal the master
who guided him in his first years, but he follows his style as much
as he can, with less talent."<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id=
"FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class=
"fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>It was not therefore Benozzo's work which enlarged the master's
style, but in the Vatican frescoes the master clearly <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
shows the effort he has himself made to render the action of his
figures more grand, his painting more solid, figures more
characteristic and the episodes with which his admirable
compositions are enriched more fundamentally truthful.</p>

<p>These paintings prove that he had reached his greatest artistic
development; although always retaining his innate character he
concedes to the new requirements of art as much of his temperament
and sentiment, as he can conscientiously yield. Thus his works
display a continuous improvement, each new stage in the long road
of his artistic career, represents a fresh conquest, a new and
remarkable progress. His pupils and collaborators limited
themselves to aiding him, and rendering his work lighter in parts
of secondary importance, but he needed no other help to be, and
always remain, worthy of the high company in which he finds himself
in the Vatican.</p>

<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Sixtine Chapel, near the quiet creations of the artists
of the Renaissance, the power and awful force of Michelangelo stand
out; in the "Stanze" Raphael has left an everlasting wealth of
artistic treasures; and in the Chapel of Nicholas V. Fra Angelico
with ingenuous expression and the purest and most sincere religious
feeling, painted his master-piece.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>But notwithstanding the great difference between the
former giants of art, and our saintly artist, he is quite worthy of
their glorious company.</p>

<p>The sweet gentleness of his character was all that hindered him
from a more exact and deep study of reality, but it was precisely
by means of this character that he succeeded, as no one else could
do, in expressing the elevated ideas of his serene and calm soul,
profound inspiration and na&iuml;ve freshness of faith.</p>

<p>In 1455 after a life entirely dedicated to art, Fra Giovanni, at
the age of 68 years, died in Rome, having well earned the grateful
veneration of posterity. The austere virtues of his soul gained him
the title of <i>Beato</i> (blessed) and for the lovely lines traced
by his brush, he was called <i>Angelico</i>. A marble monument was
erected over his tomb in the church of the Minerva, with his effigy
and the following inscription, said to have been dictated by Pope
Nicholas V. himself:</p>
